# Tool Results Visibility Fix - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Issue:** Tool results not visible to LLM across the codebase
**Status:** ✅ FIXED in all locations

## Overview

Fixed critical bugs where tool results weren't properly visible to the LLM, breaking the feedback loop between tool execution and agent decision-making. These bugs existed in multiple locations with slightly different manifestations.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. TaskExecutor: Tool Results Added to Wrong Message List

**File:** `task_executor_agent.py:332-339`

**Problem:**
Tool results were added to LOCAL `messages` variable (used for context isolation), but `build_context()` used `self.state.messages` (persistent state).

```python
# BEFORE - Bug
messages.append({  # LOCAL variable
    "role": "tool",
    "content": tool_result_str,
})
```

**Impact:**
- LLM never saw tool results in subsequent rounds
- Completion detector nudges invisible to LLM
- Agent couldn't learn from success/failure

**Fix:**
Add tool results to BOTH local messages (for isolation) AND persistent state (for LLM visibility):

```python
# AFTER - Fixed
tool_message = {
    "role": "tool",
    "content": tool_result_str,
}
messages.append(tool_message)  # For context isolation
self.add_message(tool_message)  # For LLM visibility
```

**Results:**
- L1-L6 tasks: 3-12x faster (average 5.4x speedup)
- Completion signaling: 2-8 rounds instead of 20-round timeout
- All tasks properly signal completion

### 2. Orchestrator: String Conversion + Combining Results

**Files:**
- `orchestrator_main.py:124-147` (initial message handling)
- `orchestrator_main.py:196-219` (interactive loop)

**Problem 1 - String Conversion:**
Tool results converted to Python string representation instead of JSON:

```python
# BEFORE - Bug
orchestrator.add_message({
    "role": "tool",
    "content": str(tool_results),  # Wrong! Python string repr
})
```

**Problem 2 - Combining Results:**
Multiple tool results combined into ONE message instead of one message per tool:

```python
# BEFORE - Bug
tool_results = []
for tc in msg["tool_calls"]:
    result = execute_orchestrator_tool(tc, registry, server_manager)
    tool_results.append(result)

# ONE message for ALL results
orchestrator.add_message({"role": "tool", "content": str(tool_results)})
```

**Impact:**
- Malformed tool results (Python repr instead of JSON)
- Breaks OpenAI message format (one tool message per tool call required)
- Potential parsing errors when LLM interprets results

**Fix:**
JSON encode each result and send one message per tool call:

```python
# AFTER - Fixed
for tc in msg["tool_calls"]:
    result = execute_orchestrator_tool(tc, registry, server_manager)

    # ONE message per tool call, properly JSON encoded
    tool_result_str = json.dumps(result)
    orchestrator.add_message({
        "role": "tool",
        "content": tool_result_str,
    })
```

### 3. Test Files: Same Pattern as Orchestrator

**Files:**
- `tests/test_orchestrator_live.py:88-98`
- `tests/test_with_delegation.py:90-104`

**Problem:**
Same bugs as orchestrator_main.py:
- String conversion instead of JSON
- Combining multiple results into one message

**Fix:**
Applied same fix as orchestrator_main.py. Added `import json` to both files.

## Testing

### TaskExecutor Testing

**Test:** `analysis/test_completion_fix.py`

```
Goal: Create hello.py with a function greet(name)

Results:
✓ File created correctly
✓ Function exists with correct implementation
✓ Completed in 2 rounds (not 20-round timeout)
```

**Evaluation:** `analysis/quick_eval_l1_l6.py`

| Level | Before | After | Speedup |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| L1 | 18.5s | 4.2s | 4.4x |
| L2 | 17.9s | 5.0s | 3.6x |
| L3 | 39.3s | 9.7s | 4.1x |
| L4 | 132.5s | 10.7s | **12.4x** |
| L5 | 67.3s | 13.3s | 5.1x |
| L6 | 23.5s | 7.8s | 3.0x |

**Average speedup:** 5.4x faster

### Orchestrator Testing

No automated tests run yet. Manual testing recommended before production use.

**Suggested test:**
```bash
python orchestrator_main.py "Create a simple hello world script"
```

Expected: Orchestrator should see delegation results and respond appropriately.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why These Bugs Existed

1. **Context isolation feature** - Local message clearing was added for subtask transitions, but tool results weren't also added to persistent state

2. **Code duplication** - orchestrator_main.py had two nearly identical code blocks (initial + interactive), both with the same bugs

3. **Informal message handling** - Using `str()` instead of `json.dumps()` for convenience, breaking proper message format

### Why They Were Hard to Find

1. **No errors** - Everything executed successfully, bugs only affected LLM behavior
2. **Files created correctly** - Agent code quality was fine, only completion signaling broken
3. **Debug script bypassed bug** - Manual testing accidentally used correct code path
4. **Symptom was timeout** - Could have many causes, required deep investigation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify LLM sees tool results** - Add logging/tracing to confirm messages in context
2. **Use proper JSON encoding** - Never use `str()` for structured data sent to LLM
3. **Follow message format specs** - One tool message per tool call (OpenAI format)
4. **Test both code paths** - When code is duplicated, bugs often replicate
5. **Context isolation must preserve visibility** - Local clearing is fine, but LLM needs persistent view

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **DONE:** Fix TaskExecutor tool results
2. ✅ **DONE:** Fix Orchestrator tool results
3. ✅ **DONE:** Fix test files
4. ⚠️ **TODO:** Test orchestrator with real delegation
5. ⚠️ **TODO:** Add integration test for tool result visibility
6. ⚠️ **TODO:** Consider extracting tool execution into BaseAgent to avoid duplication

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fixes
- TaskExecutor: Worked but appeared slow (20-round timeouts)
- Orchestrator: Potentially broken (malformed messages to LLM)
- Tests: Passing but using wrong message format

### After Fixes
- TaskExecutor: 5.4x faster with proper completion signaling
- Orchestrator: Proper JSON messages, one per tool call
- Tests: Consistent with production code

## Verification Checklist

- [x] TaskExecutor tool results visible to LLM
- [x] TaskExecutor completion detection working
- [x] TaskExecutor evaluation passing (L1-L6)
- [x] Orchestrator using JSON encoding
- [x] Orchestrator sending one message per tool
- [x] Test files using same correct pattern
- [ ] Orchestrator tested with real delegation
- [ ] Integration tests added
- [ ] BaseAgent refactoring considered

## Conclusion

These were **critical architectural bugs** that broke the fundamental feedback loop between tool execution and agent decision-making. The fixes are simple (add to both message lists, use JSON encoding, one message per tool), but the impact is massive (5.4x speedup).

The bugs demonstrate the importance of:
- Careful message handling in multi-agent systems
- Proper JSON encoding for structured data
- Testing LLM context visibility, not just file outputs
- Deep investigation when symptoms are subtle (timeouts, not errors)

All production code paths are now fixed and consistent.
