KEY FINDINGS
================================

✅ WINS:
1. L5 tasks improved dramatically (44% → 78%)
   - Todo app: 0/3 → 2/3 (detailed specs helped!)
   - Inventory: 1/3 → 2/3 (better guidance)

2. Circuit breaker now works! (0/1 → 2/3)
   - Detailed algorithm explanation helped
   - No more immediate hangs

3. Overall stability: 30 rounds consistently
   - No LLM timeouts
   - Models working through problems

❌ REGRESSIONS:
1. Observer pattern catastrophic failure (3/3 → 0/3)
   - Too much detail may confuse model
   - Complex multi-step instructions overwhelming

2. L6 completely failing now (44% → 0%)
   - All architecture patterns struggling
   - Detailed specs not helping (hurting?)

3. DI also regressed (1/3 → 0/3)

4. Still one parameter invention error (line_end)
   - Circuit breaker run 3 failed with write_file(line_end=...)
   - Bash migration mostly working but not 100%

COMPARISON: Before vs After
================================

BEFORE (with context clearing, simple specs):
  L5: 4/9  = 44%
  L6: 4/9  = 44%  (observer was 3/3!)
  L7: 0/6  = 0%
  Total: 8/24 = 33%

AFTER (with context clearing + bash tools + detailed specs):
  L5: 7/9  = 78%  ⬆️
  L6: 0/9  = 0%   ⬇️⬇️⬇️
  L7: 2/9  = 22%  ⬆️
  Total: 9/27 = 33%

================================
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================

Detailed specs help when:
  ✓ Task is data-centric (models, CRUD)
  ✓ Algorithm needs explanation (circuit breaker)
  ✓ Clear step-by-step structure

Detailed specs hurt when:
  ✗ Pattern is well-known (observer, factory)
  ✗ Too many instructions (information overload)
  ✗ LLM already knows the pattern well

Observer pattern example:
  - Before: "Create observer pattern: Subject, Observer classes..."
    Result: 3/3 passed (model knew what to do)
  
  - After: 12 lines of detailed instructions
    Result: 0/3 passed (model confused by detail)

================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================

1. Revert L6 specs to simpler form
   - Assume model knows architecture patterns
   - Just specify interfaces/methods needed

2. Keep L7 detailed specs
   - Circuit breaker proof it helps
   - Complex algorithms need explanation

3. Consider hybrid approach:
   - Simple overview + key details
   - Not step-by-step instructions

4. Fix remaining write_file parameter invention
   - Add explicit warning in system prompt
   - Or simplify write_file to single content param
