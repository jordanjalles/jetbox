1. I'm not seeing the task tree and subtasks visualizer until the first task is completed. I'd like a visual to pop up as soon as it starts working. it can even be a substring or tool call per llm call.
2. The performance stats should reset on each new agent task.
3. Separate the HRM-JEPA project into a new different github project. JetBox will exclusively be the agent framework.
4. Update readme with the title line "JetBox â€” a fast, compact, and slightly dangerous local agent framework built for speed, autonomy, and total on-device control. Makes your fan scream like a jet at takeoff."
5. Include jetbox.png in the readme (if possible) (also located in tasks for claude folder right now)
