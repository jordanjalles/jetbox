title: Repo Bootstrap for HRM+JEPA Project
milestone: M0
status: in_progress
created: 2025-10-20
assignee: local_agent

goal: |
  Create the foundational repository structure for the HRM+JEPA multimodal AI system.
  This includes project layout, build configuration, development tooling, and initial tests.

constraints:
  - Must run on Windows 10/11 with RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM)
  - Python 3.11+ required
  - Use Conda for environment management
  - Local-only processing (no network calls in code)
  - All paths must be Windows-compatible

deliverables:
  project_structure:
    - core/
    - core/encoders/
    - core/objectives/
    - core/hrm/
    - data/text/
    - data/images/
    - data/manifests/
    - scripts/
    - ui/
    - configs/
    - tests/unit/
    - tests/integration/
    - docs/
    - tools/

  files:
    - pyproject.toml: "Build configuration with ruff, black, mypy, pytest"
    - environment.yml: "Conda environment with PyTorch 2.3+, CUDA 12.x"
    - .pre-commit-config.yaml: "Pre-commit hooks for format, lint, types"
    - README.md: "Project overview and setup instructions"
    - .gitignore: "Ignore __pycache__, .venv, checkpoints, logs"
    - tests/unit/test_smoke.py: "Minimal smoke test to validate setup"
    - docs/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md: "High-level system architecture"

acceptance_tests:
  - name: "Environment creates successfully"
    command: "conda env create -f environment.yml"
    expected: "Environment created without errors"

  - name: "Pre-commit hooks install"
    command: "pre-commit install"
    expected: "Hooks installed successfully"

  - name: "Smoke tests pass"
    command: "pytest tests/unit/test_smoke.py -q"
    expected: "All tests pass"

  - name: "Linting passes"
    command: "ruff check ."
    expected: "No errors"

  - name: "Formatting check passes"
    command: "black --check ."
    expected: "All files properly formatted"

  - name: "Type checking passes"
    command: "mypy core/ --strict"
    expected: "No type errors (or only in stub files)"

performance_targets:
  - "Environment creation: < 5 minutes"
  - "Test execution: < 5 seconds"
  - "Lint + format check: < 10 seconds"

safety_checks:
  - "No network calls in any Python modules"
  - "All imports are from standard library or specified dependencies"
  - "No hardcoded absolute paths (use pathlib.Path)"

definition_of_done:
  - All directories created with proper structure
  - All configuration files present and valid
  - pytest passes with at least one smoke test
  - ruff, black, mypy all pass
  - Pre-commit hooks functional
  - README has clear setup instructions
  - Can run: conda env create && conda activate hrm-jepa && pytest -q

rollback_plan: |
  If bootstrap fails:
  1. Delete the newly created directory
  2. Review error logs
  3. Fix configuration issues
  4. Re-run from scratch

dependencies:
  - Windows 10/11 with WSL2 or native Python
  - Conda or Miniconda installed
  - Git installed
  - RTX 3090 with CUDA drivers

estimated_effort: "2-4 hours"

notes: |
  This is the foundation for all future work. Take time to get it right.
  All future tickets will build on this structure.

  Key principle: Keep it minimal but complete. Don't add features beyond M0 scope.
