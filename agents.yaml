# Agent Configuration
# Defines available agents and their delegation relationships
#
# This file ONLY contains:
# - Agent class names (for instantiation)
# - Delegation relationships (can_delegate_to)
#
# Agent-specific configuration (blurbs, delegation_tool schemas, behaviors)
# is defined in individual agent config files (e.g., orchestrator_config.yaml)

agents:
  # Orchestrator: User-facing agent that plans and delegates
  orchestrator:
    class: OrchestratorAgent
    can_delegate_to:
      - architect       # Can consult architect for complex projects
      - task_executor   # Can delegate implementation work

  # Architect: Architecture design consultant
  architect:
    class: ArchitectAgent
    can_delegate_to: []  # Consultant agent (doesn't delegate)

  # TaskExecutor: Coding agent that executes specific tasks
  task_executor:
    class: TaskExecutorAgent
    can_delegate_to: []  # Executor doesn't delegate (terminal agent)
