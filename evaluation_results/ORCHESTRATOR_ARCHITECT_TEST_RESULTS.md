# Orchestrator + Architect Integration Test Results

**Test Date:** 2025-10-31
**Test:** L8 Web Application with Architect
**Duration:** ~180 seconds (timeout)

## Test Goal

Create a complete todo web application with:
- Backend: FastAPI REST API with JWT authentication
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS interface
- Database: SQLite with schema and migrations
- Tests: API endpoint tests

## What Worked ✅

### 1. Architect Consultation
The orchestrator successfully:
- Detected `[Use architect for planning]` hint in the goal
- Invoked architect via `consult_architect` tool
- Waited for architect to complete its work

### 2. Architect Output
The architect created comprehensive architecture documentation:

**System Overview** (`architecture/system-overview.md`):
- Component breakdown (Frontend, Backend, Database, Testing)
- Technology choices with trade-offs explained
- Data flow diagrams
- Clear decision rationale

**Module Specifications** (5 files in `architecture/modules/`):
- `backend-api.md` - FastAPI implementation details
- `frontend-ui.md` - React/TypeScript UI specs
- `database.md` - SQLite schema and migrations
- `testing.md` - Pytest and Jest test plans
- `documentation.md` - README requirements

**Task Breakdown** (`architecture/task-breakdown.json`):
```json
{
  "total_tasks": 6,
  "tasks": [
    {"id": "T1", "description": "Implement FastAPI backend..."},
    {"id": "T2", "description": "Create React frontend..."},
    {"id": "T3", "description": "Define SQLite schema..."},
    {"id": "T4", "description": "Implement tests..."},
    {"id": "T5", "description": "Write migration scripts..."},
    {"id": "T6", "description": "Create README..."}
  ]
}
```

Each task includes:
- Priority ordering
- Dependencies (e.g., T2 depends on T1)
- Estimated complexity (low/medium/high)
- Module reference

### 3. Orchestrator Delegation
After architect completed:
- Orchestrator correctly parsed task list
- Delegated first task (T1: FastAPI backend) to TaskExecutor
- Passed task description and workspace path

## What Didn't Work ❌

### Task Executor Execution
The TaskExecutor received the delegated task but got stuck:
- Ran for 13+ rounds showing "AGENT STATUS: 💤 idle"
- Made LLM calls (12 total) but minimal tool executions (12 actions)
- Never called `mark_complete` or `mark_failed`
- Context grew to 60K+ tokens without progress
- Eventually hit timeout (180s)

**Root Cause:** The TaskExecutor with SubAgentStrategy appears to have the same idle loop issue we saw in earlier tests. The LLM is responding but not making effective tool calls to complete the work.

## Architecture Quality Assessment

The architect produced **high-quality** architecture documentation:

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Proper component separation (frontend/backend/database)
- ✅ Technology choices justified with trade-offs
- ✅ Task dependencies correctly identified
- ✅ Complexity estimates realistic
- ✅ Module specs detailed and actionable

**Example Module Spec Quality:**
From `backend-api.md`:
- Endpoint specifications with HTTP methods
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication flow details
- Database model definitions
- Error handling requirements

## Conclusion

**Architect Integration: SUCCESS ✅**
- The orchestrator → architect → orchestrator flow works correctly
- Architecture quality is production-ready
- Task breakdown is actionable with proper dependencies

**Task Execution: INCOMPLETE ❌**
- TaskExecutor needs debugging to fix idle loop issue
- SubAgentStrategy is correctly set up but LLM behavior needs investigation
- The completion tools (`mark_complete`/`mark_failed`) exist but aren't being called

## Next Steps

1. **Fix TaskExecutor idle loop** - Investigate why LLM isn't calling tools effectively
2. **Test single task delegation** - Verify mark_complete works in isolation
3. **Retry L8 test** - Once TaskExecutor is fixed, rerun this test to completion
4. **Validate task dependency handling** - Ensure orchestrator can iterate through tasks T1→T6

## Recommendation

The orchestrator architecture is sound:
- Multi-agent delegation works
- Architect produces excellent output
- SubAgentStrategy design is correct

The issue is in the **TaskExecutor's LLM prompt engineering or tool selection logic**, not in the orchestrator framework itself.
