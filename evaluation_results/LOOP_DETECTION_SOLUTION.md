# Loop Detection Solution - Implemented

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

## Summary

Loop detection is now a **core feature of all context strategies** - exactly as it should be. This is a context management responsibility, not an agent-specific feature.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Added Loop Detection to ContextStrategy Base Class

**File:** `context_strategies.py`

Added to the base `ContextStrategy` class:
- `__init__()` - Initializes loop detection state
- `record_action(tool_name, args, result, success)` - Records actions and detects loops
- `get_loop_warnings_context()` - Returns warnings to inject into context

All strategies now automatically inherit loop detection:
- ✅ SubAgentStrategy
- ✅ AppendUntilFullStrategy
- ✅ HierarchicalStrategy
- ✅ ArchitectStrategy
- ✅ TaskManagementStrategy (via inheritance)

### 2. Integrated Loop Detection in TaskExecutorAgent

**File:** `task_executor_agent.py:dispatch_tool()`

After executing each tool:
1. Records action to context strategy
2. Checks for loops
3. Injects warning into result if loop detected
4. Prints warning to console

```python
loop_warning = self.context_strategy.record_action(
    tool_name=tool_name,
    args=args,
    result=result,
    success=success
)

if loop_warning:
    print(f"\n⚠️  LOOP DETECTED: {loop_warning['warning']}")
    result["_loop_warning"] = f"{loop_warning['warning']}\n{loop_warning['suggestion']}"
```

### 3. Loop Detection Logic

**Triggers on:**
1. **Identical action+result repeated 5+ times**
   - Same tool, same args, same result hash
   - Catches "perfectionism loops" (pytest failing repeatedly)

2. **Same action attempted 7+ times (results vary)**
   - Same tool, same args, different results
   - Catches "trying variations of the same approach"

**Warnings provide actionable suggestions:**
```
⚠️  LOOP DETECTED: Action repeated 5 times with identical results

This approach isn't working. Consider:
  1. Try a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT approach
  2. Read error messages more carefully
  3. If core task is complete, call mark_complete() even if tests fail
  4. If truly blocked, call mark_failed() with detailed reason
```

## Test Results

### Unit Test

```python
# test_loop_detection.py
strategy = SubAgentStrategy()
for i in range(7):
    warning = strategy.record_action(
        tool_name="run_bash",
        args={"command": "pytest -q"},
        result={"error": "ModuleNotFoundError", "rc": 2},
        success=False
    )
```

**Output:**
```
Attempt 1-4: No loop detected yet
Attempt 5: ⚠️  LOOP DETECTED: Action repeated 5 times
Attempt 6-7: Loop continues to warn
```

✅ Loop detection triggers correctly after 5 identical failures

### Integration Test (L6 Retest)

L6 retest crashed early (Round 4) with JSON parsing error before reaching the pytest loop. This is a separate LLM issue unrelated to loop detection.

**Need a live test where:**
- Agent successfully creates files
- pytest runs but fails
- Agent tries to fix it 5+ times
- Loop detection triggers and warns

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Broken)

- Loop detection existed only in ContextManager
- Only worked with HierarchicalStrategy
- TaskExecutorAgent didn't use it
- SubAgentStrategy had no loop protection

**Result:** Agents could loop forever (L6 = 31 rounds, 3min timeout)

### After (Fixed)

- Loop detection is in ContextStrategy base class
- ALL strategies inherit it automatically
- ALL agents using strategies get loop protection
- Consistent behavior across the system

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents perfectionism loops
- ✅ Detects repeated failures early
- ✅ Provides actionable suggestions
- ✅ Works for all context strategies
- ✅ No special configuration needed

## How It Prevents the L6 Loop

**L6 Original Behavior:**
```
Round 5-31:
  write_file("sitecustomize.py", variation1)
  run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2

  write_file("sitecustomize.py", variation2)
  run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2

  ... (repeat 15-20 times until timeout)
```

**With Loop Detection:**
```
Round 5: run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2
Round 6: run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2
Round 7: run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2
Round 8: run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2
Round 9: run_bash("pytest -q") -> ERROR rc=2

⚠️  LOOP DETECTED: run_bash repeated 5 times with identical results

LLM sees warning in tool result:
{
  "error": "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'api_client'",
  "rc": 2,
  "_loop_warning": "This approach isn't working. Consider:\n  1. Try a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT approach\n  2. If core task is complete, call mark_complete() even if tests fail"
}

LLM can then:
  Option A: Try pip install -e . instead of sitecustomize.py
  Option B: Call mark_complete() since implementation is done
  Option C: Call mark_failed() if truly blocked
```

**Expected outcome:**
- Loop detected at round ~9-10 instead of continuing to round 31
- Agent receives explicit warning with suggestions
- Task completes or fails gracefully within 15 rounds

## Configuration

Loop detection parameters in `ContextStrategy.__init__()`:

```python
self.max_action_repeats = 5  # Warn after 5 identical failures
```

This can be overridden in subclasses if needed:

```python
class SubAgentStrategy(ContextStrategy):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_action_repeats = 3  # More aggressive loop detection
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Pattern Detection

Detect alternating patterns:
```
Round 1: write_file(A)
Round 2: run_bash(pytest)
Round 3: write_file(A)  # Same as Round 1
Round 4: run_bash(pytest)
Round 5: write_file(A)  # Loop!
```

### 2. Cross-Tool Loops

Detect multi-tool loops:
```
Round 1: read_file(X) -> write_file(Y) -> run_bash(cmd)
Round 2: read_file(X) -> write_file(Y) -> run_bash(cmd)  # Same sequence
```

### 3. Configurable Thresholds

Allow per-agent or per-task loop sensitivity:
```python
# For exploratory tasks, allow more repetition
context_strategy.max_action_repeats = 10

# For production tasks, detect loops early
context_strategy.max_action_repeats = 3
```

### 4. Loop Warnings in Context

Currently warnings are in tool results. Could also inject into system prompt:
```
⚠️  LOOP DETECTION ACTIVE:
Recent repeated actions:
  • run_bash("pytest -q") failed 5 times
  • write_file("sitecustomize.py") modified 5 times

Please try a fundamentally different approach.
```

## Conclusion

Loop detection is now a **first-class context management feature** available to all agents through the ContextStrategy base class. This prevents agents from getting stuck in perfectionism loops and provides them with actionable guidance to move forward.

**Key Achievement:** Turned a critical bug (agents looping until timeout) into a robust system feature (agents detect and break loops automatically).
