# Timeout Fix Verification - Progress Report

## Test Configuration

**Tests**: L3-2, L3-3, L4-1, L5-2 (the 4 tests with timeout issues)

- **Improvement**: +13% pass rate, eliminated all timeouts!
- **Status**: Fix working as expected

**Failures**:
- Iter 1: unknown_failure (75.3s, 0 rounds) - likely due to Ollama not ready at start

#### L3-3: Add Feature to Package
**Result**: 3/6 passed (50%) ⚠️ **REGRESSION**

- **Current timeouts**: 1
- **Current infinite loops**: 2
- **Change**: -20% pass rate
- **Status**: Still has workspace navigation issues

**Failures**:
- Iter 4: timeout (240s, 0 rounds)

#### L4-1: TodoList with Persistence
**Result**: 5/6 passed (83%) ✓ **IMPROVED**
- **Previous run**: 7/10 (70%) with 3 timeouts
- **Current timeouts**: 1 (was 3)
- **Improvement**: +13% pass rate, 67% timeout reduction
- **Status**: Major improvement

**Failures**:
- Iter 5: timeout (300s, 0 rounds)

#### L5-2: Large-Scale Refactoring
**Result**: 1/6 passed (17%) ✗ **MAJOR REGRESSION**
- **Previous run**: 7/10 (70%) with 2 timeouts
- **Current timeouts**: 4
- **Current infinite loops**: 1
- **Change**: -53% pass rate
- **Status**: Much worse - needs investigation

**Failures**:
- Iter 1: timeout (360s, 0 rounds)
- Iter 2: timeout (360s, 0 rounds)
- Iter 3: timeout (360s, 0 rounds)
- Iter 5: infinite_loop (256.8s, 123 rounds)
- Iter 6: timeout (360s, 0 rounds)

## Analysis

### What's Working

1. **L3-2 shows dramatic improvement** - No timeouts vs 3 before
2. **L4-1 improved significantly** - 67% reduction in timeouts
3. **Ollama health checks functioning** - Warning messages appearing correctly
4. **Timeout wrapper is catching hangs** - Tests showing "0 rounds" are timing out at test level, not hanging forever

### What's Not Working

1. **L5-2 is much worse** - 4/6 timeouts with 0 rounds suggests decompose_goal() is consistently timing out
   - Possible cause: Complex refactoring task overwhelms the decomposition LLM call
   - The 120s timeout might be triggering before decomposition completes
   - May need longer timeout for complex tasks or better decomposition strategy

2. **L3-3 still has issues** - Infinite loops suggest workspace navigation problems persist
   - This is a known issue from previous analysis
   - Timeout fix doesn't address infinite loops, only prevents hangs

### Timeout Behavior Patterns

**Tests with "0 rounds" timeout**:
- L3-3 iter 4: 240s timeout, 0 rounds
- L4-1 iter 5: 300s timeout, 0 rounds
- L5-2 iters 1,2,3,6: 360s timeout, 0 rounds

This pattern suggests:
- `decompose_goal()` is timing out (our 120s wrapper)
- Agent falls back to simple task structure
- But then something else blocks before reaching main loop
- **OR** the fallback task structure isn't being used correctly

### Questions for Further Investigation

1. **Why is L5-2 timing out so consistently?**
   - Is 120s timeout too short for complex task decomposition?
   - Is the fallback task structure inadequate for complex tasks?
   - Should we have different timeout values for different task complexities?

2. **What happens after decompose_goal() timeout fallback?**
   - Need to check logs to see if fallback task is created
   - Is there another blocking point before main loop starts?

3. **Is Ollama actually running during these tests?**
   - Health check shows "not responding" but tests still pass sometimes
   - Suggests intermittent Ollama availability or cached responses?

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for iterations 7-10 to complete** - Get full 40-run dataset
2. **Analyze timeout_retest_results.json** - Detailed failure analysis
3. **Check agent logs** - See what happens during "0 rounds" timeouts
4. **Consider timeout adjustments** - May need longer timeout for complex tasks
5. **Review fallback behavior** - Ensure fallback task structure works correctly

## Expected Completion

- Current iteration: 7/10
- Estimated time remaining: ~15-20 minutes
- Final report will include comparison with previous run
