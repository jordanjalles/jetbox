The water temperature is around 22\u202f\u00b0C, which is comfortably warm for most swimmers and reduces the risk of hypothermia. Recent water\u2011quality tests show that the bacterial count is below the recreational\u2011water threshold of 200\u202fCFU/100\u202fmL, so the risk of gastrointestinal illness is low. In addition, a licensed lifeguard is on duty, and studies have shown that lifeguard presence can cut the likelihood of a drowning incident by about 90\u202f%.  \n\nAll of these factors together mean that the overall chance of a serious incident is very small \u2013 roughly 1 in 10,000, or about 0.1\u202f%.

{"id": "20251020_172156_0012", "question": "If it's windy, should I go swimming?", "answer": "**Short answer:**  \nIf the wind is strong enough to create large waves, choppy water, or a noticeable current, it\u2019s safest to skip the swim (or at least stay very close to shore). If the wind is mild and the water looks calm, you can swim, but keep a few extra precautions in mind.\n\n---\n\n## Why wind matters for swimming\n\n| Wind factor | Effect on water | Safety concern |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| **Wind speed** | 10\u201315\u202fmph (\u2248\u202f16\u201324\u202fkm/h) can start to generate noticeable waves on a beach or lake. 20\u202fmph+ can create large, rolling waves. | Waves can knock swimmers off balance, increase fatigue, and make it harder to stay afloat. |\n| **Wind direction** | On a beach, wind blowing from the shore toward the water pushes waves toward the shore. On a lake, wind can create a \u201cwind\u2011driven current.\u201d | Currents can pull swimmers away from shore or toward a boat/structure. |\n| **Wind chill** | Cold air can lower body temperature quickly, especially in water. | Hypothermia risk increases if you\u2019re in the water longer than expected. |\n| **Visibility** | Wind can stir up sand and debris, reducing visibility. | Harder to spot hazards or rescue personnel. |\n\n---\n\n## Step\u2011by\u2011step checklist before you decide\n\n1. **Check local advisories**  \n   - Look for beach or lake warnings (red flags, \u201cno swimming\u201d notices).  \n   - Many coast\u2011guard or park websites publish real\u2011time conditions.\n\n2. **Measure wind speed**  \n   - Use a handheld anemometer or a weather app.  \n   - 10\u201315\u202fmph = mild\u2011to\u2011moderate; 15\u201320\u202fmph = strong; >20\u202fmph = very strong.\n\n3. **Observe the water**  \n   - Calm, flat surface = safe for most swimmers.  \n   - Rolling waves, whitecaps, or a \u201cswell\u201d = caution.  \n   - Look for rip currents (often indicated by a line of foam or a darker patch).\n\n4. **Consider your own factors**  \n   - **Experience & fitness**: Stronger swimmers can handle a bit more turbulence.  \n   - **Equipment**: Life jackets, wetsuits, or flotation devices help in rough water.  \n   - **Time of day**: Wind can pick up later in the day; early morning is often calmer.\n\n5. **Plan your exit strategy**  \n   - Know the nearest exit points.  \n   - Keep a short distance from the shore if you\u2019re in a windy environment.\n\n---\n\n## Practical tips if you decide to swim\n\n| Tip | Why it helps |\n|-----|--------------|\n| **Stay close to shore** | Easier to get out quickly if you get tired or caught in a current. |\n| **Use a flotation device** | Adds buoyancy and reduces the effort needed to stay afloat. |\n| **Swim with a buddy** | You can spot each other and call for help if needed. |\n| **Watch the flags** | Red or yellow flags usually mean \u201cno swimming\u201d or \u201cbe cautious.\u201d |\n| **Check the water temperature** | Cold water + wind can lead to hypothermia faster. |\n| **Don\u2019t dive in** | Waves can cause head\u2011first impacts or disorient you. |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\n- **Strong wind (\u2265\u202f15\u202fmph) + visible waves or currents** \u2192 **Skip the swim** or stay very close to shore with a buddy.  \n- **Mild wind (<\u202f10\u202fmph) + calm water** \u2192 **Swim safely** with the usual precautions.  \n- **If in doubt** \u2192 **Wait**.
