## Technical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Tool Dispatch for Architect** ✅
**Issue**: Architect tool calls (write_architecture_doc, write_module_spec) weren't routed correctly
**Fix**: Added `dispatch_tool()` override in ArchitectAgent to handle architect-specific tools

### 2. **Workspace Configuration** ✅
**Issue**: When orchestrator changed architect workspace, tools still referenced old workspace
**Fix**: Added `configure_workspace()` method to update both workspace path and tool configuration

### 3. **State Serialization** ✅
**Issue**: `ToolCall` objects from LLM responses weren't JSON serializable
**Fix**: Added `_serialize_message()` method to AgentState to convert ToolCall objects to dicts

### 4. **Path Import Error** ✅
**Issue**: `UnboundLocalError` when using `Path` in execute_orchestrator_tool
**Fix**: Removed duplicate local `from pathlib import Path` statement

## Workflow Verification

### ✅ Step 1: User → Orchestrator
- User provides complex project request
- Orchestrator receives request in interactive or `--once` mode

### ✅ Step 2: Orchestrator Complexity Assessment
- Orchestrator analyzes request for:
  - Multi-component systems
  - Technology stack decisions needed
  - Performance/scaling concerns
  - Complex integrations
- **Decision**: Consult architect OR delegate directly to task executor

### ✅ Step 3: Orchestrator → Architect (if complex)
- Orchestrator calls `consult_architect` tool with:
  - `project_description`
  - `requirements`
  - `constraints`
  - `workspace_path` (optional)

### ✅ Step 4: Architect Consultation
- Architect runs for up to 10 rounds
- Creates artifacts using 5 tools:
  - `write_architecture_doc` → High-level system design
  - `write_module_spec` → Detailed module specifications
  - `write_task_list` → Structured task breakdown (JSON)
  - `list_architecture_docs` → Query existing artifacts
  - `read_architecture_doc` → Read existing docs
- All artifacts stored in `workspace/architecture/`

### ✅ Step 5: Architect → Orchestrator (return)
- Architect returns:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "artifacts": {
      "docs": ["architecture/system-overview.md"],
      "modules": ["architecture/modules/auth-service.md", ...],
      "task_breakdown": "architecture/task-breakdown.json"
    },
    "workspace": ".agent_workspace/project-name"
  }
  ```

### ✅ Step 6: Orchestrator Reads Task Breakdown
- Orchestrator parses `architecture/task-breakdown.json`
- Identifies tasks with:
  - Task ID
  - Description
  - Module reference
  - Dependencies
  - Complexity estimate
  - Priority

### ✅ Step 7: Orchestrator → TaskExecutor (for each task)
- Orchestrator calls `delegate_to_executor` with:
  - `task_description` (includes reference to architecture spec)
  - `workspace_mode: "existing"`
  - `workspace_path` (shared workspace)
  - `additional_context` (optional architecture details)

### ✅ Step 8: TaskExecutor Implements Task
- TaskExecutor runs in subprocess
- Has access to:
  - Shared workspace (can read architecture docs)
  - Task description
  - Module specifications
- Implements code per architecture specifications

### ✅ Step 9: TaskExecutor → Orchestrator (return)
- TaskExecutor returns completion status
- Orchestrator moves to next task in breakdown

### ✅ Step 10: Orchestrator → User (completion)
- All tasks complete
- Workspace contains:
  - Architecture documentation (persistent)
  - Implementation code (from task executors)
  - Tests, configuration, infrastructure

### ✅ Architect Artifact Quality
- High-level system architecture ✅
- Detailed module specifications ✅
- Structured task breakdowns with dependencies ✅
- Technology stack decisions ✅
- Implementation guidance ✅

### ✅ Task Delegation
- Orchestrator reads task breakdown ✅
- Delegates with architecture references ✅
- Passes workspace path correctly ✅
- Task executor accesses architecture docs ✅

### ✅ Workspace Coordination
- Single shared workspace ✅
- Architecture artifacts persist ✅
- Task executor can read architect docs ✅
- No workspace path conflicts ✅

## Performance

### Architect Consultation
- **Rounds**: 4-10 rounds (depends on complexity)
- **Artifacts**: 1-8 module specs, 1 architecture doc, 1 task breakdown
- **Time**: ~30-60 seconds (with LLM)

### Task Delegation
- **Overhead**: Minimal (simple subprocess spawn)
- **Context**: Architecture docs available in workspace
- **Isolation**: Each task executor runs independently

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Milestone 3: Enhanced Orchestrator Logic
- Parse task dependencies
- Delegate tasks in dependency order
- Track completion status
- Report progress to user

- Orchestrator re-consults architect with feedback
- Versioned architecture artifacts

### Milestone 5: Multi-Task Orchestration
- Orchestrator delegates multiple tasks in parallel
