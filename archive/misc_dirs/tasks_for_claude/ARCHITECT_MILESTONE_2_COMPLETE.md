# Architect Agent - Milestone 2 Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully completed **Milestone 2: Orchestrator Integration** - the Architect agent is now fully integrated with the Orchestrator, enabling the complete workflow: User → Orchestrator → Architect → Orchestrator → TaskExecutor → User.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Orchestrator Tool: `consult_architect`** (`orchestrator_agent.py`)

Added new tool to OrchestratorAgent for consulting the architect on complex projects.

**Tool Definition:**
```python
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "consult_architect",
        "description": "Consult the Architect agent for complex project design and planning...",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "project_description": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "High-level description of the project to architect"
                },
                "requirements": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Functional and non-functional requirements..."
                },
                "constraints": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Technical, resource, or timeline constraints..."
                },
                "workspace_path": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Optional: existing workspace path..."
                }
            },
            "required": ["project_description"]
        }
    }
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Multi-component/multi-service systems
- Complex data flows or processing pipelines
- Technology stack decisions needed
- Performance/scaling concerns
- Multi-stage workflows
- Complex integrations

**When to Skip (delegate directly):**
- Simple single-file scripts
- Small feature additions
- Bug fixes
- Straightforward CRUD applications

### 2. **Updated Orchestrator System Prompt** (`orchestrator_agent.py`)

Enhanced system prompt with:
- **Complexity assessment section** - guidance on when to consult architect
- **Architect workflow example** - shows full flow with artifact consumption
- **Clear decision criteria** - helps orchestrator decide when to use architect

**Key Addition:**
```markdown
COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT (NEW STEP):

Before delegating, assess if the project needs architecture design:

CONSULT ARCHITECT when:
- Multi-component/multi-service systems (auth + API + database + messaging)
- Complex data flows or processing pipelines
- Technology stack decisions needed
- Performance/scaling concerns
- Multi-stage workflows (ETL, CI/CD, event-driven)
- Complex integrations between systems

SKIP ARCHITECT (delegate directly) when:
- Simple single-file scripts
- Small feature additions to existing code
- Bug fixes
- Straightforward CRUD applications

Example 4 - COMPLEX PROJECT (with Architect):
User: "build a real-time analytics platform"
→ consult_architect(
      project_description="real-time analytics platform with streaming data",
      requirements="handle 1M events/sec, multi-tenant isolation, real-time dashboards",
      constraints="AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes deployment, 4-person team"
  )
→ [Architect produces: architecture docs, module specs, task breakdown]
→ Read architecture/task-breakdown.json
→ delegate_to_executor(
      task_description="Implement data ingestion service per architecture/modules/ingestion.md",
      workspace_mode="existing",
      workspace_path=".agent_workspace/real-time-analytics-platform"
  )
→ [Continue delegating remaining modules from task breakdown]
```

### 3. **Consultation Handler** (`orchestrator_main.py`)

Implemented `consult_architect` handler in `execute_orchestrator_tool()`:

**Flow:**
1. Extract parameters from tool call (project_description, requirements, constraints)
2. Create/reuse workspace from project description slug
3. Get architect agent from registry
4. Configure architect workspace
5. Run consultation (max 10 rounds)
6. Return artifacts info to orchestrator
7. Log consultation events to console

**Key Code:**
```python
def execute_orchestrator_tool(tool_call, registry, server_manager=None):
    tool_name = tool_call.get("function", {}).get("name")

    if tool_name == "consult_architect":
        args = tool_call.get("function", {}).get("arguments", {})
        project_description = args.get("project_description", "")
        requirements = args.get("requirements", "")
        constraints = args.get("constraints", "")
        workspace_path_str = args.get("workspace_path")

        # Create workspace
        if workspace_path_str:
            workspace = Path(workspace_path_str)
        else:
            slug = slugify(project_description[:60])
            workspace = Path(f".agent_workspace/{slug}")

        workspace.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

        # Get architect agent
        architect = registry.get_agent("architect")
        architect.workspace = workspace

        # Run consultation
        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print("ARCHITECT CONSULTATION")
        print('='*60)
        print(f"Project: {project_description}")
        if requirements:
            print(f"Requirements: {requirements[:70]}...")
        if constraints:
            print(f"Constraints: {constraints[:70]}...")
        print('='*60 + "\n")

        result = architect.consult(
            project_description=project_description,
            requirements=requirements,
            constraints=constraints,
            max_rounds=10
        )

        # Return artifacts info
        return {
            "success": True,
            "artifacts": result["artifacts"],
            "workspace": str(workspace)
        }
```

### 4. **End-to-End Test Suite** (`tests/test_architect_orchestrator_e2e.py`)

Comprehensive test suite covering the full integration:

**Test 1: Registry Delegation Permissions**
- Verifies orchestrator can delegate to architect
- Verifies architect cannot delegate (consultant model)
- Verifies orchestrator can still delegate to task_executor

**Test 2: Orchestrator Tool Availability**
- Verifies orchestrator has `consult_architect` tool
- Verifies orchestrator has `delegate_to_executor` tool
- Lists all available orchestrator tools

**Test 3: Basic Integration**
- Simulates orchestrator calling `consult_architect`
- Verifies tool call routing works
- Verifies workspace is created
- Verifies result structure is correct
- Gracefully handles no-LLM scenario (tests mechanics only)

**Test 4: Workflow Documentation**
- Documents the complete e2e flow
- Shows expected flow for complex project request
- Demonstrates artifact creation and consumption
- Shows orchestrator reading task breakdown
- Shows orchestrator delegating to task executor per architecture

## Complete Workflow

The full integration now supports this workflow:

### Scenario: User Requests Complex Project

**Step 1: User → Orchestrator**
```
User: "Build a real-time chat application with user authentication"
```

**Step 2: Orchestrator Complexity Assessment**
- Orchestrator recognizes: multi-component (auth + chat + real-time)
- Decision: Consult architect before delegating

**Step 3: Orchestrator → Architect**
```python
consult_architect(
    project_description="real-time chat application with user authentication",
    requirements="real-time messaging, user auth, message persistence",
    constraints="web-based, support 100 concurrent users"
)
```

**Step 4: Architect Works (10 rounds max)**
- Asks clarifying questions (if needed)
- Designs architecture
- Creates artifacts:
  - `architecture/system-overview.md`
  - `architecture/modules/auth-service.md`
  - `architecture/modules/chat-service.md`
  - `architecture/modules/websocket-server.md`
  - `architecture/task-breakdown.json`

**Step 5: Architect → Orchestrator**
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "artifacts": {
        "docs": ["architecture/system-overview.md"],
        "modules": [
            "architecture/modules/auth-service.md",
            "architecture/modules/chat-service.md",
            "architecture/modules/websocket-server.md"
        ],
        "task_breakdown": "architecture/task-breakdown.json"
    },
    "workspace": ".agent_workspace/real-time-chat-application"
}
```

**Step 6: Orchestrator Reads Task Breakdown**
```json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "id": "T1",
            "description": "Implement auth service",
            "module": "auth-service",
            "priority": 1,
            "dependencies": []
        },
        {
            "id": "T2",
            "description": "Implement chat service",
            "module": "chat-service",
            "priority": 2,
            "dependencies": ["T1"]
        },
        {
            "id": "T3",
            "description": "Implement WebSocket server",
            "module": "websocket-server",
            "priority": 2,
            "dependencies": ["T1"]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Step 7-9: Orchestrator → TaskExecutor (for each task)**
```python
# Task 1
delegate_to_executor(
    task_description="Implement auth service per architecture/modules/auth-service.md",
    workspace_mode="existing",
    workspace_path=".agent_workspace/real-time-chat-application"
)

# Task 2
delegate_to_executor(
    task_description="Implement chat service per architecture/modules/chat-service.md",
    workspace_mode="existing",
    workspace_path=".agent_workspace/real-time-chat-application"
)

# Task 3
delegate_to_executor(
    task_description="Implement WebSocket server per architecture/modules/websocket-server.md",
    workspace_mode="existing",
    workspace_path=".agent_workspace/real-time-chat-application"
)
```

**Step 10: Orchestrator → User**
```
Project complete! Architecture and implementation in:
  .agent_workspace/real-time-chat-application/

Architecture:
  ✓ architecture/system-overview.md
  ✓ architecture/modules/auth-service.md
  ✓ architecture/modules/chat-service.md
  ✓ architecture/modules/websocket-server.md
  ✓ architecture/task-breakdown.json

Implementation:
  ✓ Auth service implemented
  ✓ Chat service implemented
  ✓ WebSocket server implemented
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- ✅ Architecture documents created and persisted
- ✅ Module specifications guide implementation
- ✅ Task breakdown structures the work
- ✅ All modules implemented per architecture
- ✅ Single workspace contains everything

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

While Milestone 2 is complete, potential enhancements could include:

**Milestone 3: Enhanced Artifact Handling**
- Orchestrator reads and displays architecture summary
- Task breakdown parser with dependency resolution
- Progress tracking across multiple task executor delegations

**Milestone 4: Architecture Refinement Loop**

- Orchestrator can re-consult architect with feedback
- Versioned architecture artifacts

**Milestone 5: Context Archiving Strategy**
- Implement archive/rewind context strategy for architect
- Allow reviewing past architectural decisions
- Support "why did we choose X?" queries

---

## Testing Instructions

### Without LLM (mechanics only):
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python tests/test_architect_orchestrator_e2e.py
```

### With LLM (full workflow):
```bash
python orchestrator_main.py
# Then in interactive mode:
> build a real-time analytics platform with streaming data ingestion and dashboards
```

Expected behavior with LLM:
1. Orchestrator assesses complexity (recognizes multi-component system)
2. Orchestrator calls `consult_architect`
3. Architect asks clarifying questions
4. Architect creates architecture documents
5. Architect creates task breakdown
6. Orchestrator reads task breakdown
7. Orchestrator delegates each task to task executor
8. All implementation in single workspace

---

## Conclusion

**Milestone 2 is complete!** The Architect agent is now fully integrated with the Orchestrator, enabling sophisticated multi-agent workflows for complex projects. The system supports:

- ✅ Intelligent complexity assessment
- ✅ Architecture-first approach for complex projects
- ✅ Artifact-driven task delegation
- ✅ Shared workspace coordination
- ✅ Backward compatibility with simple direct delegation

The foundation is solid for building complex multi-component systems with proper architectural design upfront.
