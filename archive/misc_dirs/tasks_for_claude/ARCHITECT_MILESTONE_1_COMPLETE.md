# Architect Agent - Milestone 1 Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented **Milestone 1: Basic Architect Agent MVP** - a software architecture consultant agent that produces structured artifacts for complex projects.

## What Was Built

### 1. **ArchitectStrategy** (`context_strategies.py`)

A specialized context strategy for architecture design conversations:
- **Higher token limit** (32K default) for verbose architecture discussions
- **Append-until-full** with intelligent compaction
- **No jetbox notes** (artifacts are the persistent output)
- **Architecture-focused summarization** (requirements, decisions, trade-offs)

**Key Features:**
```python
class ArchitectStrategy(ContextStrategy):
    def __init__(self, max_tokens=32000, recent_keep=20, use_jetbox_notes=False)
    def should_use_jetbox_notes() -> bool  # Returns False
    def build_context(...)  # Optimized for architecture conversations
```

### 2. **Architect Tools** (`architect_tools.py`)

Five specialized tools for creating architecture artifacts:

| Tool | Purpose | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| `write_architecture_doc` | High-level system design | `architecture/*.md` |
| `write_module_spec` | Detailed module specifications | `architecture/modules/*.md` |
| `write_task_list` | Structured task breakdown (JSON) | `architecture/task-breakdown.json` |
| `list_architecture_docs` | List existing artifacts | Metadata |
| `read_architecture_doc` | Read existing docs | Doc content |

**Artifact Structure:**
```
workspace/
└── architecture/
    ├── system-overview.md         # High-level architecture
    ├── data-flow-architecture.md  # Optional additional docs
    ├── modules/
    │   ├── auth-service.md        # Module specifications
    │   ├── api-gateway.md
    │   └── data-pipeline.md
    └── task-breakdown.json        # Structured task list
```

### 3. **ArchitectAgent** (`architect_agent.py`)

The main architect agent class:
- **Consultant model**: Produces artifacts, doesn't execute code
- **Project-focused**: Designed for architecture conversations
- **Interactive**: Can ask clarifying questions
- **Artifact-driven**: All output is persisted documentation

**System Prompt Highlights:**
- Clear role definition: "Software Architect agent"
- Step-by-step workflow (understand → design → refine → document → break down)
- Trade-off focused: "No perfect solution - explain alternatives"
- Tool-driven: "ALWAYS create artifacts"
- High-level focus: "You design architecture, not implement code"

**Main API:**
```python
agent = ArchitectAgent(workspace, project_description)
result = agent.consult(
    project_description="Build a real-time analytics platform",
    requirements="1M events/sec, multi-tenant isolation",
    constraints="AWS + Kubernetes, 4-person team",
    max_rounds=10
)
# Returns: {"status": "success", "artifacts": {...}}
```

### 4. **Integration** (`agents.yaml`, `agent_registry.py`)

- **Added to agent registry**: Orchestrator can now delegate to architect
- **Delegation permissions**: Orchestrator → Architect (consultant, no sub-delegation)
- **Clean instantiation**: Registry creates ArchitectAgent instances

**Configuration:**
```yaml
agents:
  orchestrator:
    can_delegate_to:
      - architect      # NEW
      - task_executor

  architect:           # NEW
    class: ArchitectAgent
    can_delegate_to: []  # Consultant (terminal)
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/test_architect_agent.py`)

Four test suites covering all functionality:
- ✅ Agent creation and configuration
- ✅ Tool functionality (all 5 tools)
- ✅ Registry integration
- ✅ Context strategy behavior

**All tests pass!**

## Example Usage

### Basic Consultation
```python
from architect_agent import ArchitectAgent
from pathlib import Path

# Create architect
agent = ArchitectAgent(
    workspace=Path(".agent_workspace/my-project"),
    project_description="E-commerce platform"
)

# Run consultation
result = agent.consult(
    project_description="E-commerce platform with real-time inventory",
    requirements="Support 10K concurrent users, payment integration, order tracking",
    constraints="Team of 3, prefer Python/FastAPI, 3-month timeline"
)

# Check artifacts
print(result["artifacts"])
# {
#     "docs": ["architecture/system-overview.md"],
#     "modules": ["architecture/modules/auth.md", "architecture/modules/api.md", ...],
#     "task_breakdown": "architecture/task-breakdown.json"
# }
```

### From Agent Registry
```python
from agent_registry import AgentRegistry

registry = AgentRegistry()
architect = registry.get_agent("architect")

# Architect is now available for orchestrator delegation
assert registry.can_delegate("orchestrator", "architect")
```

## Architecture Artifact Examples

### Architecture Document
```markdown
# System Overview

*Generated: 2025-10-31 10:30:00*

## Components
### API Gateway
- Routes requests to microservices
- Handles authentication via JWT

### Auth Service
- User registration and login
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Database Layer
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- Redis for session caching

## Data Flow
User → API Gateway → Auth Service → Database
                   → Other Services
```

### Module Specification
```markdown
# Module: auth-service

## Responsibility
Handle user authentication and session management

## Interfaces
### Inputs
- username: string - User login name
- password: string - Plain text password (hashed internally)

### Outputs
- token: JWT - Authentication token (expires in 1h)

### APIs
- POST /auth/login - Authenticate user
- POST /auth/logout - Invalidate token

## Dependencies
- PostgreSQL: user data storage
- Redis: session cache

## Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.11
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Auth**: PyJWT, bcrypt

## Implementation Notes
Use bcrypt for password hashing with cost factor 12.
Implement token refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions.
```

### Task Breakdown
```json
{
  "generated_at": "2025-10-31T10:30:00",
  "total_tasks": 5,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "description": "Implement authentication service",
      "module": "auth-service",
      "priority": 1,
      "dependencies": [],
      "estimated_complexity": "medium"
    },
    {
      "id": "T2",
      "description": "Implement API gateway routing",
      "module": "api-gateway",
      "priority": 2,
      "dependencies": ["T1"],
      "estimated_complexity": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

## What's Next (Milestone 2)

Now that the basic architect agent works, the next step is **Orchestrator Integration**:

1. **Add `consult_architect` tool** to Orchestrator
2. **Update Orchestrator prompt** with architect workflow guidance
3. **Implement consultation handler** in `orchestrator_main.py`
4. **End-to-end workflow test**: User → Orchestrator → Architect → TaskExecutor

This will enable the full workflow:
```
User: "Build a microservices platform"
Orchestrator: [recognizes complexity] → consult_architect
Architect: [asks questions, produces artifacts]
Orchestrator: [reads task breakdown] → delegate to executors
```

✅ **Workspace-aligned**: Uses workspace model, architecture/ subdirectory
✅ **Strategy-based**: Custom context strategy for architecture discussions
✅ **Tool-complete**: 5 tools cover all architecture needs
✅ **Fully tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
✅ **Registry-integrated**: Works with existing agent infrastructure
✅ **Ready for orchestrator integration**: Foundation for Milestone 2

## Conclusion

**Milestone 1 is complete!** The Architect agent MVP is fully functional and ready for orchestrator integration. All design goals met:

- ✅ Consultant model (not executor)
- ✅ Artifact creation in workspace
- ✅ Simplified context strategy (no archiving complexity)
- ✅ Workspace-aligned subdirectory structure
- ✅ Clean integration with existing infrastructure

The foundation is solid for building out the full workflow in Milestone 2.
