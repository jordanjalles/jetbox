# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 20:52:26
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 27

### Task 2: Write tests for complex expressions **[CURRENT]**

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/1 completed

- ? **Write tests/test_dsl_complex.py with tests for expressions like 'sin(x) + sqrt(y^2 + z)' and nested functions**
  - Status: decomposed
  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 12

  - ⟳ **Create a file named tests/test_dsl_complex.py and add an import statement for the evaluate function from the dsl module.**
    - Status: in_progress
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function named test_sin_plus_sqrt_expression to tests/test_dsl_complex.py that evaluates the expression 'sin(x) + sqrt(y^2 + z)' with variables x=0, y=3, z=4 and asserts the result equals math.sqrt(13) within a tolerance of 1e-6.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function named test_nested_functions_sin_cos to tests/test_dsl_complex.py that evaluates the expression 'sin(cos(x))' with variable x=0 and asserts the result equals math.sin(1) within a tolerance of 1e-6.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function named test_nested_sqrt_sin_cos to tests/test_dsl_complex.py that evaluates the expression 'sqrt(sin(x)^2 + cos(y)^2)' with variables x=0, y=0 and asserts the result equals 1.0 within a tolerance of 1e-6.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Run pytest to execute the test suite and verify that all tests in tests/test_dsl_complex.py pass.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2


### Task 3: Run tests 

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/1 completed

- ○ **Run pytest tests/test_dsl_complex.py**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1


## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created dsl_parser.py
