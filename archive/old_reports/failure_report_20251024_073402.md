# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 07:34:02
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** No more subtasks and max retries exhausted: Run tests to verify DSL functionality

- Created test_dsl.py
- Created tests/test_dsl.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
