# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 10:35:34
**Goal:** Build a thread-safe task queue system with worker threads, priority levels, retry logic on failure, and graceful shutdown. Include comprehensive tests for concurrency edge cases.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 18

## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created queue.py
- Created queue.py
- Created worker.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
