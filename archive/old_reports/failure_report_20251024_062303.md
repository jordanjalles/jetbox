# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 06:23:03
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 1

## Summary

- **Tasks Completed:** 0/2
- **Current Task Index:** 0

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create DSL implementation files **[CURRENT]**

- **Status:** in_progress

**Subtasks:** 0/3 completed

- ⟳ **Use write_file to create dsl_parser.py with lexer and parser for expressions, variables, sin, cos, sqrt**
  - Status: in_progress
  - Depth: Level 1

- ○ **Use write_file to create dsl_interpreter.py with evaluation logic for parsed AST**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1

- ○ **Use write_file to create dsl_main.py that ties parser and interpreter together**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1


### Task 2: Create tests and run them 

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/3 completed
