# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 23:28:22
**Goal:** Build a thread-safe task queue system with worker threads, priority levels, retry logic on failure, and graceful shutdown. Include comprehensive tests for concurrency edge cases.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 45

### Task 2: Write comprehensive concurrency tests for the task queue **[CURRENT]**

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/2 completed

- ? **write_file: tests/test_task_queue.py with tests for priority ordering, retry on failure, and graceful shutdown under concurrent load**
  - Status: decomposed
  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 12

  - ⟳ **Create tests/test_task_queue.py file and add necessary imports for pytest and the task queue module.**
    - Status: in_progress
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Write test_priority_ordering function that enqueues tasks with different priorities and asserts they are processed in correct order, then run pytest to confirm the test passes.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Write test_retry_on_failure function that enqueues a task that fails first and succeeds on retry, assert retry logic, then run pytest to confirm the test passes.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Write test_graceful_shutdown_under_concurrent_load function that starts the task queue with multiple workers, enqueues many tasks, triggers shutdown, and asserts no tasks are lost, then run pytest to confirm all tests pass.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

- ○ **run_cmd: pytest -q tests/test_task_queue.py**

## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created task_queue.py
- Created task_queue.py
- Created worker.py
- Created __init__.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
