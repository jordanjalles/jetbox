# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 11:48:44
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 73

- ? **write_file tests/test_dsl.py with complex expression tests**
  - Status: decomposed
  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 12

  - ⟳ **Create tests/test_dsl.py file with imports from dsl and a placeholder test function named test_placeholder.**
    - Status: in_progress
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add test_complex_list_and_read to tests/test_dsl.py that uses list_dir on a temporary directory and read_file on a file, asserting correct types.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add test_complex_write_and_read to tests/test_dsl.py that writes a string to a temporary file using write_file and reads it back with read_file, asserting equality.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add test_nested_expression to tests/test_dsl.py that obtains a file path from list_dir and then reads that file using read_file, asserting content.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add test_combined_operations to tests/test_dsl.py that writes a file, reads it, appends a string from list_dir, writes again, and verifies final content.**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2


### Task 2: Run tests to verify DSL functionality **[CURRENT]**

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/1 completed

## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created dsl/parser.py
- Created dsl/interpreter.py
- Created dsl/__init__.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
