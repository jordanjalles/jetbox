# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 19:02:52
**Goal:** Build a thread-safe task queue system with worker threads, priority levels, retry logic on failure, and graceful shutdown. Include comprehensive tests for concurrency edge cases.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 93

  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 12

  - ⟳ **Create an empty tests/test_task_queue.py file**
    - Status: in_progress
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function test_priority_ordering that verifies tasks are executed in priority order**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function test_retry_behavior that verifies a task is retried on failure up to max retries**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Add a test function test_graceful_shutdown_under_concurrent_load that verifies the queue shuts down gracefully when tasks are being processed concurrently**

## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created task_queue.py
- Created task_queue/__init__.py
- Created worker.py
- Created task_queue/worker.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
