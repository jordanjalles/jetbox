# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 22:25:33
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** No more subtasks and max retries exhausted: Create tests and run them

## Summary

- **Tasks Completed:** 2/3
- **Current Task Index:** 2
