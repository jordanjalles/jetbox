# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 09:33:45
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 6
