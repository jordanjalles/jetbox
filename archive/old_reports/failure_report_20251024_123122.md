# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-24 12:31:22
**Goal:** Design a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for mathematical expressions with variables, functions (sin, cos, sqrt), and implement a parser and interpreter. Include tests for complex expressions.
**Failure Reason:** Ollama timeout: No response for 30s on round 15

### Task 2: Implement parser and interpreter **[CURRENT]**

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 1/3 completed

- ✓ **write_file: parser.py with a recursive descent parser for the DSL syntax**
  - Status: completed
  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 6
  - **Accomplishments:**
    - Created parser.py
  - **Notes:** Completed: 1 actions, Rounds: 6

- ? **write_file: interpreter.py that evaluates parsed AST nodes using the DSL classes**
  - Status: decomposed
  - Depth: Level 1
  - Rounds Used: 12

  - ⟳ **Create interpreter.py with an Interpreter class skeleton and an evaluate method stub**
    - Status: in_progress
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Implement evaluate method to handle 'list_dir' AST node by calling DSL's list_dir and returning result**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Write test_interpreter_list_dir.py that constructs a list_dir AST node, runs interpreter, asserts returned list equals expected**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Run pytest for test_interpreter_list_dir.py and verify it passes**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

  - ○ **Write test_interpreter_read_file.py that constructs a read_file AST node, runs interpreter, asserts returned content equals expected**
    - Status: pending
    - Depth: Level 2

- ○ **read_file: dsl.py to reference DSL definitions in the parser and interpreter**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1


### Task 3: Write tests for complex expressions and run them 

- **Status:** pending

**Subtasks:** 0/3 completed

- ○ **write_file: tests/test_dsl.py with unit tests covering nested functions, variable usage, and error cases**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1

- ○ **run_cmd: python -m pytest tests/test_dsl.py**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1

- ○ **list_dir: tests**
  - Status: pending
  - Depth: Level 1


## Identified Blockers

No specific blockers identified.

## Progress Achieved

- Created dsl.py
- Created dsl/__init__.py
- Created parser.py

## Recommendations

Based on this failure analysis:
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
