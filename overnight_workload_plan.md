## Execution Strategy

### Logging Infrastructure

**Per-Test Logging:**
```python
{
  "run_id": "L3-1-run-0001",
  "test_id": "L3-1",
  "attempt": 1,
  "timestamp_start": "2025-01-21T22:00:00Z",
  "timestamp_end": "2025-01-21T22:00:15Z",
  "duration": 15.3,
  "rounds": 6,
  "actions": 12,
  "success": true,
  "failure_mode": null,
  "workspace": ".agent_workspace/...",
  "output_log": "logs/L3-1-run-0001.txt",
  "agent_ledger": "logs/L3-1-run-0001-ledger.log",
  "performance": {...}
}
```

**Master Log:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "overnight-2025-01-21",
  "start_time": "2025-01-21T22:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-01-22T06:00:00Z",
  "total_duration": 28800,
  "tests_run": 145,
  "tests_passed": 98,
  "tests_failed": 47,
  "overall_pass_rate": 0.676,
  "results_by_level": {...},
  "hrm_tasks_completed": 4,
  "report_path": "overnight_report_2025-01-21.md"
}
```

### Error Handling

**Crash Recovery:**
- Each test runs in isolated subprocess
- Timeout protection (max 12 min per test)
- Workspace cleanup between tests
- State preserved on crashes
- Resume from last checkpoint

**Resource Management:**
- Monitor disk space (stop if <5GB free)
- Check Ollama availability
- Rate limit LLM calls (prevent throttling)
- Clean up old workspaces periodically
