# Eval Suite x10 - Detailed Failure Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Overall Performance:** 68/90 passed (75.6%)

The agent performed well overall with a 75.6% success rate across 90 test runs (9 tests × 10 iterations). However, there are several critical issues that need attention:

1. **L4-2 completely broken** - 100% failure rate
2. **Timeouts in later iterations** - Suggests state pollution between runs
3. **Intermittent infinite loops** - Loop detection working but underlying issue remains

### Problematic Tests (70% Pass Rate)

⚠️ **L3-2: Fix Buggy Code** - 7/10 passed (70%)
- **Failures:** Iterations 7, 8, 10
- **Failure mode:** Timeout (240s, 0 rounds)
- **Root cause:** Agent fails to decompose goal into tasks at all
- **Pattern:** Only fails in later iterations - suggests state pollution

⚠️ **L3-3: Add Feature to Package** - 7/10 passed (70%)
- **Failures:** Iterations 4, 5, 7
- **Failure modes:**
  - Infinite loop (2 occurrences): Agent gets stuck in exploration
  - Timeout (1 occurrence): Similar to above
- **Root cause:** Complex workspace navigation - agent looks for existing mathx package structure
- **Note:** This was 0/5 before workspace isolation fix! Now 70% - huge improvement

⚠️ **L4-1: TodoList with Persistence** - 7/10 passed (70%)
- **Failures:** Iterations 2, 7, 10
- **Failure mode:** Timeout (300s, 0 rounds)
- **Root cause:** Same as L3-2 - fails to decompose at all
- **Pattern:** Only fails in later iterations

⚠️ **L5-2: Large-Scale Refactoring** - 7/10 passed (70%)
- **Failures:** Iterations 7, 8, 10
- **Failure modes:**
  - Timeout: 2 occurrences (360s, 0 rounds)
  - Unknown failure: 1 occurrence (32.6s, 14 rounds)
- **Root cause:** Complex refactoring + state pollution in later iterations

### Critically Broken Test (0% Pass Rate)

❌ **L4-2: Debug Failing Tests** - 0/10 passed (CRITICAL)
- **Failures:** ALL 10 iterations
- **Failure mode:** unknown_failure
- **Duration:** Consistently 7-25s, only 5-6 rounds
- **Root cause:** Agent cannot handle the test setup correctly

**Investigation needed:**
The test sets up `broken.py` and `test_broken.py` in the workspace. Agent fails immediately after only 5-6 rounds. This suggests:
1. Agent may not be understanding the task
2. Setup files may not be accessible
3. Test infrastructure may have an issue with this specific test

## Failure Mode Analysis

### 1. Unknown Failure (11 occurrences)

**Affected:** L4-2 (10x), L5-2 (1x)

**Characteristics:**
- Very quick failures (7-32s)
- Only 5-14 rounds executed
- No clear error message in results

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- L4-2: Test setup issue or agent doesn't understand debugging task
- May be related to how agent interprets "fix failing tests" vs "write new code"

### 2. Timeout (9 occurrences)

**Affected:** L3-2 (3x), L3-3 (1x), L4-1 (3x), L5-2 (2x)

**Characteristics:**
- Always 0 rounds executed
- Agent never even starts working
- **Only happens in later iterations (iterations 2, 5, 7, 8, 10)**

**Root Cause:**
**STATE POLLUTION BETWEEN TEST RUNS**

The pattern is clear: tests fail to decompose goals only in later iterations. This suggests:
1. `.agent_context` state is not being cleaned between tests
2. Old goal state persists and confuses the agent
3. Agent sees existing state and thinks goal is already complete or blocked

**Fix Required:**
- Ensure `clean_agent_state()` in `run_stress_tests.py` is being called properly
- May need to add explicit state reset in context_manager when goal description changes

### 3. Infinite Loop (2 occurrences)

**Affected:** L3-3 (2x)

**Characteristics:**
- 157-236s duration
- 49-94 rounds executed
- Loop detection eventually triggers

**Root Cause:**
Agent gets confused navigating existing mathx package structure. Even with workspace isolation fix, occasionally still gets stuck in exploration loops looking for files.

**Why it's better now:**
- Was 0/5 (100% failure) before workspace fix
- Now 7/10 (70% success) - major improvement
- Remaining failures are intermittent, not systematic

## Level Performance

**Level 3 (Advanced):** 24/30 (80.0%)
- Good performance
- Issues are with timeouts (state pollution)

**Level 4 (Expert):** 17/30 (56.7%) ⚠️
- **Worst performing level**
- Dragged down by L4-2 (0/10) complete failure
- Without L4-2: would be 17/20 (85%)

**Level 5 (Extreme):** 27/30 (90.0%)
- **Best performing level**
- Complex tasks actually work better (agent decomposes properly)
- Only issues are timeouts in late iterations

## Critical Issues Requiring Fixes

### Priority 1: L4-2 Complete Failure

**Impact:** 10/90 failures (11% of all failures)

**Investigation needed:**
1. Run L4-2 manually and check logs
2. Verify test setup files are created correctly
3. Check if agent can even see the files
4. May need to improve agent's understanding of "debug failing tests" task

### Priority 2: State Pollution Between Tests

**Impact:** 9/90 failures (10% of all failures)

**Symptoms:**
- 0 rounds executed
- Only in later iterations
- Agent fails to decompose goal

**Fix:**
```python
# In run_stress_tests.py clean_agent_state()
def clean_agent_state():
    if Path(".agent_workspace").exists():
        shutil.rmtree(".agent_workspace")
    if Path(".agent_context").exists():
        shutil.rmtree(".agent_context")  # CRITICAL: This must happen
    # ... rest of cleanup
```

Verify this function is called BETWEEN EVERY TEST, not just between iterations.

### Priority 3: L3-3 Intermittent Loops

**Impact:** 2-3/90 failures (2-3% of all failures)

**Status:** Much improved (was 100% failure, now 30% failure)

**Potential improvements:**
- Add better heuristics for "file already exists, move on"
- Improve context about what's already been accomplished
- May need to tweak loop detection threshold for exploration tasks

---

## Wins & Improvements

### Major Success: L3-3 Workspace Isolation Fix

**Before:** 0/5 (100% failure)
**After:** 7/10 (70% success)

The workspace isolation fix resolved the fundamental issue where agent couldn't find files. Remaining failures are edge cases, not systematic problems.

### Excellent Performance on Complex Tasks

**L5-1, L5-3:** 20/20 (100%)
**L5-2:** 7/10 (70%)

Level 5 tasks have 90% overall success rate, showing that:
- Agent handles complexity well
- Decomposition strategy works for hard problems
- Multi-file tasks are reliable

### Reliable Simple Tasks

**L3-1, L4-3:** 20/20 (100%)

Basic refactoring and optimization tasks are rock solid.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Fix L4-2:** Debug manually to understand why it fails immediately
   - May need to revise test setup
   - May need to improve agent's understanding of debugging tasks
   - Consider adding explicit "run pytest and fix failures" in task description

2. **Fix State Pollution:** Ensure `.agent_context` is cleaned between tests
   - Verify `clean_agent_state()` is called in the right place
   - Add explicit logging to confirm cleanup happens
   - Consider adding state validation before each test

3. **Investigate Timeout Pattern:** Check why only iterations 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 have issues
   - Is there a pattern related to previous test outcomes?
   - Does a failed test leave state that affects next test?

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Improve Context Management**
   - Add better state isolation between goals
   - Make goal description check more robust
   - Log when old state is detected and handled

2. **Enhance Loop Detection**
   - Add heuristics for "exploration complete"
   - Better detection of "spinning on same directory"
   - Consider adding a "breadcrumb" system to track explored paths

3. **Better Error Reporting**
   - "unknown_failure" should have more details
   - Capture agent logs for failed tests
   - Add structured error categories

---

## Conclusion

The agent performs well overall (75.6%), but has two critical issues:

1. **L4-2 is completely broken** - needs immediate investigation
2. **State pollution causes timeouts** - easy fix, high impact

Once these are fixed, estimated pass rate would be:
- **Without L4-2 failures:** 78/90 (86.7%)
- **Without state pollution:** 77/90 (85.6%)
- **Both fixed:** 87/90 (96.7%)

The workspace isolation fix was a huge success, improving L3-3 from 0% to 70%. Similar focused fixes on the remaining issues could push overall success rate above 95%.
