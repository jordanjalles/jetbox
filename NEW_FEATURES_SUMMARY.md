# New Features Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Scope:** Tree visualization, accomplishment tracking, and failure reporting

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Tree Structure Visualization ✅

**What Changed:**
- Rewrote `status_display.py` to show full hierarchical tree structure
- Previous: Only showed subtasks for current task
- Now: Shows complete tree with all nesting levels visible

**Implementation:**
- New method: `_render_task_tree()` - recursively renders task and subtasks
- New method: `_render_subtask_tree()` - recursively renders subtask children
- Shows depth indicators `[L2]`, `[L3]`, etc.
- Shows failure reasons inline with blocked/failed subtasks
- Shows approach attempt counts on tasks

**Example Output:**
```
TASK TREE (0/1 completed):
  ► ⟳ Test task
    ► ⟳ Parent subtask
        ✓ Child subtask (nested) [L2]
          ✗ Grandchild subtask (deeply nested) [L3]
           └─ ⚠ Test failure
```

**Files Modified:**
- `status_display.py` lines 209-284

---

### 2. Accomplishment & Failure Context Tracking ✅

**What Changed:**
- Added fields to `Subtask` dataclass to track what succeeded vs. what failed
- Automatic extraction of context from action history
- Used in approach reconsideration prompts to learn from failures

**New Fields:**
- `accomplishments: list[str]` - What was successfully completed
- `tried_approaches: list[str]` - What was attempted but failed
- `context_notes: str` - Summary of progress and blockers

**Implementation:**
- New method: `ContextManager._extract_subtask_context()` - analyzes actions
- Automatically called in `mark_subtask_complete()`
- Extracts file writes, command runs, errors from action history
- Deduplicates and summarizes

**Example Tracking:**
```python
accomplishments: ["Created test.py", "Ran pytest -q"]
tried_approaches: ["write_file broken.py: Syntax error", "run_cmd ruff: Failed"]
context_notes: "Completed: 2 actions, Failed: 2 attempts, Rounds: 5"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `context_manager.py` lines 57-77 (new fields)
- `context_manager.py` lines 212-214 (loading)
- `context_manager.py` lines 408-480 (extraction logic)
- `agent.py` lines 398-408 (using in prompts)

### 3. Comprehensive Failure Reports ✅

**What Changed:**
- Automatic generation of detailed markdown reports when tasks fail
- Captures all context: accomplishments, failures, blockers
- Provides actionable recommendations

**Implementation:**
- New function: `generate_failure_report()` - creates markdown report
- Helper: `_write_subtask_report()` - recursive subtask reporting
- Called at all failure points (max retries, safety cap, etc.)
- Reports saved to `reports/failure_report_TIMESTAMP.md`

**Report Sections:**
1. **Summary**: Task completion stats
2. **Task Breakdown**: Full hierarchy with status
3. **Identified Blockers**: What's preventing progress
4. **Progress Achieved**: What succeeded (accomplishments)
5. **Recommendations**: What to try next

**Example Report Structure:**
```markdown
# Agent Failure Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-23 01:08:42
**Goal:** Create complex package
**Failure Reason:** Max approach retries (3) exhausted

## Summary
- Tasks Completed: 1/3
- Current Task Index: 1

## Task Breakdown
### Task 1: Create package structure **[CURRENT]**
- Status: failed
- Approach Attempts: 3/3
- Failed Approaches:
  - Attempt 1: File structure failed
  - Attempt 2: Import errors
  - Attempt 3: Test failures

**Subtasks:** 2/5 completed
- ✓ **Create __init__.py**
  - Accomplishments:
    - Created src/__init__.py
  - Notes: Completed: 1 actions

- ✗ **Write tests**
  - Status: failed
  - Tried (failed):
    - write_file test.py: Import error
    - run_cmd pytest: ModuleNotFoundError
  - Failure Reason: Cannot import module
  - Notes: Failed: 2 attempts, Rounds: 6

## Identified Blockers
- **Write tests**: Cannot import module
  - Tried: write_file test.py: Import error...

## Progress Achieved
- Created src/__init__.py
- Ran ruff check

## Recommendations
1. Review the blockers listed above
2. Check if the goal is achievable with current tools
3. Consider breaking down blocked subtasks further
4. Review failed approaches to avoid repeating them
```

**Files Modified:**
- `agent.py` lines 351-518 (report generation)
- `agent.py` lines 1099-1110, 1122-1127, 1142-1147, 1169-1174 (calling at failure points)

## Testing

All features tested and verified:

```bash
$ python test_new_features.py
======================================================================
TEST 1: Tree Visualization                                          ✓
TEST 2: Accomplishment Tracking                                      ✓
TEST 3: Failure Report Generation                                    ✓
======================================================================
ALL TESTS PASSED ✓
```

## Configuration Changes

User modified `agent_config.yaml`:
- `rounds.max_per_subtask`: 6 → 12 (gives more time before escalation)

---

## Impact

### Benefits:
1. **Better Visibility**: Full tree shows entire task structure at a glance
2. **Learning from Failures**: Agent knows what worked and what didn't
3. **Debugging Aid**: Failure reports provide complete context for analysis
4. **Persistence**: Accomplishments and failures survive across retries

### Performance:
- Minimal overhead (context extraction is O(n) on actions)
- Report generation only on failure (no runtime cost during success)
- Visualization slightly larger but more informative

## Next Steps

- ✅ Run L3-L4-L5 eval (in progress: `eval_test_results.txt`)
- Analyze eval results to verify new features help with complex tasks
- Consider adding more detailed accomplishment categorization
- Maybe add visual tree to failure reports
