# Orchestrator Test Findings

## Test Date: 2025-10-27

### Test Scenario
Tested `test_orchestrator_live.py` with user request: "make a simple HTML calculator"

### Issues Found

#### 1. **Double Delegation Problem**
- **Observation**: Orchestrator delegated TWO tasks sequentially:
  1. "Create an HTML file with a calculator interface..."
  2. "Return the content of the single HTML file that was created for the calculator..."

- **Result**: The second task ran in a new isolated workspace and couldn't find the file created by the first task, causing it to hit the 12-round escalation limit.

- **Root Cause**: Each `delegate_to_executor` call launches `agent.py` as a separate subprocess with its own isolated workspace (via `WorkspaceManager`). Workspaces are isolated by design.

- **Expected Behavior**: After first delegation completes, Orchestrator should:
  - Receive completion status from TaskExecutor
  - Report back to user with file location
  - NOT delegate a second task to "return content"

#### 2. **Missing Completion Feedback Loop**
- **Current Flow**:
  ```
  Orchestrator → delegate_to_executor → subprocess.run(agent.py) → returns success/fail
  ```

- **Problem**: The TaskExecutor returns a simple success/failure dict but doesn't include:
  - What files were created
  - Where they are located
  - What the actual output/result is

- **Impact**: Orchestrator can't tell the user meaningful results like "I created calculator.html at path X"

#### 3. **Test Timeout**
- **Observation**: Test timed out after 60 seconds
- **Reason**: Second delegation got stuck in loop trying to find non-existent file
- **Escalation triggered**: After 12 rounds, forced decomposition occurred but test was already timing out

### Recommended Fixes

#### Fix 1: Improve Orchestrator System Prompt
Update `orchestrator_agent.py:132` system prompt to clarify:
- Only delegate ONCE per user request unless user explicitly asks for more
- After delegation completes, report results to user immediately
- Don't delegate tasks to retrieve or return file contents - just tell user where files are

#### Fix 2: Enhance TaskExecutor Result Reporting
Modify `orchestrator_main.py:execute_orchestrator_tool()` to return richer information:
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "message": "Task completed successfully",
    "files_created": ["calculator.html"],
    "workspace": ".agent_workspace/...",
    "summary": "Created HTML calculator with add/subtract/multiply/divide operations"
}
```

#### Fix 3: Add Workspace Context Passing
For multi-step tasks that need to span workspaces:
- Option A: Add `workspace` parameter to `delegate_to_executor` tool
- Option B: Create a persistent workspace for an entire conversation
- Option C: Use shared workspace for all orchestrator delegations

#### Fix 4: Add Explicit Completion Protocol
- TaskExecutor should write a `COMPLETION_REPORT.txt` to workspace with:
  - Files created
  - Tests run and results
  - Summary of work done
- Orchestrator reads this report after delegation completes
- Orchestrator synthesizes report into user-friendly response

### Test Success Criteria

For the test to pass, we need:
1. ✗ User makes one request
2. ✓ Orchestrator delegates once (currently works)
3. ✓ TaskExecutor completes successfully (currently works)
4. ✗ Orchestrator reports results to user (currently fails - delegates again instead)
5. ✗ Test completes within timeout (currently fails - second delegation loops)

### Next Steps

Priority order:
1. **High**: Fix Orchestrator system prompt to prevent double delegation
2. **High**: Enhance result reporting from TaskExecutor to Orchestrator
3. **Medium**: Add completion report mechanism
4. **Low**: Add workspace context passing (only if multi-workspace tasks are needed)
