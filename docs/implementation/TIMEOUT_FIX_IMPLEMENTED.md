# Timeout Fix Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

**Root Cause:** Main loop LLM call at line 1394 used `chat()` directly WITHOUT timeout protection, causing agent to hang indefinitely when Ollama degrades.

## Changes Made

### Part 1: Enhanced `chat_with_inactivity_timeout()` Function

**File:** `agent.py` lines 38-122

**Changes:**
1. Added `tools` parameter to function signature
2. Updated internal `chat()` call to conditionally pass `tools` argument
3. Modified response accumulation to include both `content` and `tool_calls`
4. Added `role: "assistant"` to response message for compatibility

**Before:**
```python
def chat_with_inactivity_timeout(model: str, messages: list, options: dict, inactivity_timeout: int = 30):
    # ... no tools support
    for chunk in chat(model=model, messages=messages, options=options, stream=True):
        # ... only accumulated content
```

**After:**
```python
def chat_with_inactivity_timeout(
    model: str,
    messages: list,
    options: dict,
    inactivity_timeout: int = 30,
    tools: list | None = None,  # ← NEW
):
    chat_args = {"model": model, "messages": messages, "options": options, "stream": True}
    if tools is not None:
        chat_args["tools"] = tools  # ← NEW
    
    full_response = {"message": {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}}  # ← FIXED
    for chunk in chat(**chat_args):
        # Accumulate content AND tool_calls  # ← NEW
```

### Part 2: Replaced Main Loop `chat()` Call

**File:** `agent.py` lines 1411-1441

**Changes:**
1. Replaced `chat()` with `chat_with_inactivity_timeout()`
2. Removed `stream=False` parameter (not needed, wrapper handles streaming)
3. Added `TimeoutError` exception handler with clear error message
4. Handler generates failure report and exits gracefully

**Before:**
```python
resp = chat(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=context,
    tools=tool_specs(),
    options={"temperature": TEMP},
    stream=False,  # ← NO TIMEOUT PROTECTION
)
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    resp = chat_with_inactivity_timeout(
        model=MODEL,
        messages=context,
        options={"temperature": TEMP},
        tools=tool_specs(),
        inactivity_timeout=30,  # ← TIMEOUT PROTECTION
    )
except TimeoutError as e:
    # Clear error message and graceful exit
    print("❌ OLLAMA TIMEOUT")
    print("Ollama stopped responding after {time}s")
    report_path = generate_failure_report(...)
    sys.exit(1)
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Basic Functionality Test
```bash
python agent.py "Create a simple test.py file"
```

**Results:**
- Agent starts successfully
- Goal decomposition works (uses timeout-protected call)
- Main loop executes successfully  
- LLM calls complete in 0.6-1.4s
- Agent makes progress through subtasks
- No hangs or timeouts

**Key Observations:**
- Round 1: 1.36s LLM call - completed successfully
- Round 2: 0.64s LLM call - completed successfully
- Agent successfully writes files and marks subtasks complete
- Tool calls work correctly with timeout wrapper

## Expected Impact on L3-L7 Tests

### Before Fix
- **10/17 failures (59%)** were timeouts with 0 rounds
- Tests hung for 240-480s before timing out
- No error messages, silent hangs
- L4-3 passed iteration 1, timed out iteration 2

### After Fix
- **Timeouts should drop to near zero**
- Fast failure if Ollama hangs (30s instead of 240-480s)
- Clear error message: "Ollama stopped responding"
- Consistent behavior across iterations

### Failure Rate Prediction
- **Current:** 16/30 failed (53% failure rate, 10 were timeouts)
- **Expected:** ~6/30 will fail (20% failure rate, 0-1 timeouts)
- **Timeout failures:** 10 → 0-1 (90-100% reduction)

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Inactivity Detection**: Fails after 30s of NO activity (not total time)
   - Allows long complex tasks to complete
   - Detects when Ollama actually stops responding

2. **Streaming with Heartbeat**: Monitors chunk arrival
   - Each chunk resets the timeout
   - Hang detected immediately after 30s of silence

3. **Graceful Degradation**: On timeout, agent:
   - Generates comprehensive failure report
   - Shows clear error message
   - Exits cleanly (test can move on)

4. **Works for All LLM Calls**: 
   - Goal decomposition: already had timeout (line 971)
   - Main loop: NOW has timeout (line 1414)
   - Both use same wrapper → consistent behavior

## Code Quality

**Linting:**
- Fixed import issues (removed unused `Queue` import)
- Fixed line length issues
- No critical errors remaining

**Error Handling:**
- Added `TimeoutError` exception handler
- Generates failure report on timeout
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Run focused test on L4-3** (the test that failed iteration 2)
   - Should now pass consistently in both iterations
   
2. **Re-run full L3-L7 test suite** (75 tests)
   - Expect timeout failures to drop from 10 to 0-1
   - Overall failure rate should improve from 53% to ~20%

3. **Optional: Add heartbeat logging** (Layer 1 from proposal)
   - Helps diagnose any remaining initialization issues
   - Shows progress during long-running tests
