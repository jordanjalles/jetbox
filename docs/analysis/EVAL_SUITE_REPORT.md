## Iteration Consistency

Consistency of results across 5 iterations:

| Iteration | Pass Rate |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 6/9 (67%) |
| 2 | 7/9 (78%) |
| 3 | 8/9 (89%) |
| 4 | 7/9 (78%) |
| 5 | 6/9 (67%) |

## Recommendations

### Max Rounds Issues

**8 tests** hit the max rounds limit. Consider:

- Increasing `max_per_subtask` in config
- Improving decomposition to create smaller, more achievable subtasks
- Adding more aggressive timeout/escalation logic
