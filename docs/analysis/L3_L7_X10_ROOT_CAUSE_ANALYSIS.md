# L3-L7 x10 Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-24
**Tests Analyzed:** 150 (15 tests √ó 10 iterations)
**Failures Analyzed:** 60 (40% failure rate)

---

## Executive Summary

Deep dive analysis of 60 failures reveals **3 distinct root causes**:

1. **25 "Unknown Failures"** ‚Üí **Actually Ollama inactivity timeouts** (30s timeout triggered)
2. **20 Infinite Loop Failures** ‚Üí Agent stuck repeating actions due to **command restrictions and file path issues**
3. **15 True Timeout Failures** ‚Üí **Subprocess timeout before agent even starts** (0 rounds)

**Key Finding:** The timeout fix IS working - it's detecting Ollama hangs. The issue is that the test framework doesn't recognize the timeout error message as a "failure" vs "success".

## Root Cause #1: "Unknown Failures" = Ollama Inactivity Timeouts

### Affected: 25 failures (42% of all failures)

**What's Happening:**
The agent runs for a few rounds, then Ollama stops responding during an LLM call. After 30 seconds of inactivity, our timeout protection triggers and the agent exits gracefully with error message.

**Example Output:**
```
[log] ROUND 1: TIMEOUT after 30.0s
[log] ROUND 1: No response from Ollama for 30s - likely hung or dead

======================================================================
‚ùå OLLAMA TIMEOUT
Ollama stopped responding after 30.0s
This usually means Ollama has hung or crashed.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why categorized as "unknown_failure":**
- Test framework looks for success patterns: "Goal achieved", "marked complete", etc.
- Agent exits with error message "OLLAMA TIMEOUT" which doesn't match success patterns
- Also doesn't match "MAX_ROUNDS" or "loop detect" patterns
- Gets categorized as "unknown_failure"

**Why Ollama is timing out:**
- Direct LLM call took 114 seconds during this test run (measured with `diag_speed.py`)
- Ollama is severely degraded/overloaded
- Some LLM calls take >30s ‚Üí inactivity timeout triggers
- **This is expected behavior** - timeout protection working correctly!

### Tests Affected

| Test | Failures | Avg Rounds | Pattern |
|------|----------|------------|---------|
| L3-1 | 4/10 | 1 | Fails on first LLM call |
| L4-1 | 3/10 | 4-10 | Fails mid-execution |
| L4-2 | 3/10 | 6 | Consistent 6 rounds |
| Others | 15/10 | Varies | Sporadic |

**L3-1 Pattern:** Fails at round 1 in 40% of iterations - this suggests Ollama is especially slow on the first LLM call after cleanup.

### Verdict: ‚úÖ NOT A BUG - Timeout Protection Working

**This is the timeout fix working correctly!**
- Detects when Ollama hangs
- Exits gracefully with clear error
- Generates failure report
- Prevents indefinite hangs

**Why it looks like a failure:**
- During this test run, Ollama was extremely degraded (114s responses)
- 30s inactivity timeout is appropriate for healthy Ollama
- With degraded Ollama, legitimate LLM calls can take >30s
- This triggers false positives

**Recommendation:**
- Test framework should recognize "OLLAMA TIMEOUT" as a specific failure type
- Consider adaptive timeout based on Ollama health check latency
- Re-run tests with healthy Ollama to confirm

## Root Cause #2: Infinite Loop Failures

### Affected: 20 failures (33% of all failures)

**What's Happening:**
Agent gets stuck in a loop repeating the same actions over and over. Loop detection triggers after detecting repeated patterns.

### Example Patterns

**Pattern A: Command Restriction Loops (L3-2, L5-1)**

```
RECENT ACTIVITY:
  ‚úì list_dir
  ‚úì list_dir
  ‚úì list_dir

Recent errors:
  ‚Ä¢ Command not allowed: ['bash', '-lc', "python..."]
  ‚Ä¢ run_cmd exception: [Errno 2] No such file or directory

‚ö† Loops detected: 1
```

**What's happening:**
1. Agent tries to run a command via bash/shell
2. Command whitelist blocks it ("Command not allowed")
3. Agent doesn't understand the error
4. Tries the same command again in different ways
5. Loop detector triggers after 3+ repeats

**Root Cause:**
- Agent not adapting to "Command not allowed" errors
- Needs to recognize this error and try a different approach
- May need better error messages explaining WHY command failed

**Pattern B: File Path Confusion Loops**

```
Recent errors:
  ‚Ä¢ run_cmd exception: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '.ag...
  ‚Ä¢ run_cmd exception: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

**What's happening:**
1. Agent tries to run command with wrong path
2. Gets "No such file or directory" error
3. Doesn't realize it's in workspace isolation
4. Keeps trying same path
5. Loop detector triggers

**Root Cause:**
- Agent not understanding workspace isolation
- Relative paths being interpreted incorrectly
- Needs clearer feedback about current working directory

### Tests Affected

| Test | Failures | Avg Rounds | Root Cause |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| L3-2 | 5/10 | 11 | Command restriction (bash) |
| L6-3 | 4/10 | 35+ | File path confusion |
| L5-1 | 2/10 | 54 | pytest command restriction |
| Others | 9/10 | Varies | Mixed |

**L3-2 "Fix Buggy Code"** - Consistent failure pattern:
- Agent tries to run Python code via bash
- Whitelist blocks bash commands
- Agent doesn't try alternative (direct python command)

**L6-3 "Legacy Code Migration"** - High round count:
- Complex task with many files
- Agent gets confused about file locations
- Repeats file operations in wrong directories

### Verdict: üêõ BUG - Error Recovery Needs Improvement

**Two improvements needed:**

1. **Better error messages:**
   ```python
   # Current
   "Command not allowed: ['bash', ...]"

   # Better
   "Command not allowed: bash is not in whitelist (python, pytest, ruff, pip only).
    Try using 'python' directly instead of bash."
   ```

2. **Error recovery strategy:**
   - Detect "Command not allowed" errors
   - Suggest alternative approaches in system prompt
   - Mark failed approach so agent doesn't retry
   - Escalate after 2-3 command restriction errors

## Root Cause #3: True Timeout Failures

### Affected: 15 failures (25% of all failures)

**What's Happening:**
The `subprocess.run()` call that executes the agent times out at the test framework level (240-480s depending on test). Agent never even starts execution - 0 rounds recorded, no output.

### Pattern

**Consistent characteristics:**
- **0 rounds executed**
- **No output at all**
- **Exact timeout duration** (240s, 360s, 420s, or 480s)
- **Sporadic** - doesn't happen every iteration

### Tests Affected

| Test | Failures | Timeout | Pattern |
|------|----------|---------|---------|
| L5-2 | 4/10 | 360s | Most affected |
| L6-2 | 3/10 | 420s | Consistent issue |
| L6-1 | 2/10 | 420s | Flask dependency |
| L7-1 | 2/10 | 480s | Complex task |
| L3-3 | 2/10 | 240s | Simple task |
| Others | 2/10 | Varies | Sporadic |

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why is the subprocess timing out before the agent even starts?**

**Hypothesis 1: Ollama health check hanging**
- Test calls `restart_ollama_if_needed()` before each test
- This checks Ollama health with 5s timeout
- If Ollama is slow, this should still pass
- Unlikely root cause

**Hypothesis 2: Goal decomposition hanging**
- Agent starts, checks Ollama (passes)
- Begins goal decomposition (LLM call)
- Decomposition has 30s inactivity timeout
- Should fail fast, not hang
- Unlikely root cause

**Hypothesis 3: Subprocess deadlock**
- `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)` buffers all output
- If agent produces huge amount of output, buffer could fill
- Process blocks writing to stdout
- Subprocess never completes
- **LIKELY ROOT CAUSE**

**Evidence for Hypothesis 3:**
- Happens on complex tests (L5-2, L6-2, L7-1)
- These tests likely produce lots of output
- Sporadic nature (depends on how much output agent generates)
- 0 rounds = process never got to log "ROUND 1"

### Verdict: üêõ BUG - Subprocess Buffer Deadlock

**Fix:** Use `subprocess.Popen` with streaming output instead of `subprocess.run` with buffered output.

**Proposed solution:**
```python
# Current (can deadlock)
proc = subprocess.run(
    ["python", "agent.py", task],
    capture_output=True,  # ‚Üê Buffers all output
    text=True,
    timeout=300,
)

# Fixed (streaming)
proc = subprocess.Popen(
    ["python", "agent.py", task],
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
    text=True,
    bufsize=1,  # Line buffered
)

# Read output line by line
output = []
for line in proc.stdout:
    output.append(line)

proc.wait(timeout=300)
```

## Summary of Root Causes

| Failure Type | Count | % of Failures | Root Cause | Severity |
|--------------|-------|---------------|------------|----------|
| "Unknown" (Ollama timeout) | 25 | 42% | Timeout fix working, Ollama degraded | ‚úÖ Not a bug |
| Infinite Loop | 20 | 33% | Command restrictions + error recovery | üêõ Medium priority bug |
| True Timeout | 15 | 25% | Subprocess buffer deadlock | üêõ High priority bug |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Subprocess Buffer Deadlock (High Impact)

**Fixes 15/60 failures (25%)**

- Implement streaming subprocess execution
- Use `Popen` instead of `run`
- Read output line-by-line to prevent buffer fill
- Expected improvement: +10% pass rate

### Priority 2: Improve Error Messages (Medium Impact)

**Fixes ~10/20 infinite loop failures**

- Add specific guidance for "Command not allowed" errors
- Show whitelist in error message
- Suggest alternative commands
- Expected improvement: +7% pass rate

### Priority 3: Better Error Recovery (Medium Impact)

**Fixes remaining ~10/20 infinite loop failures**

- Detect repeated error patterns
- Automatically escalate on command restriction errors
- Mark failed approaches to prevent retries
- Expected improvement: +7% pass rate

### Priority 4: Test Framework Recognition (Low Impact)

**Better categorization, no pass rate improvement**

- Recognize "OLLAMA TIMEOUT" as specific failure type
- Don't count as "unknown_failure"
- Better metrics and debugging

### Priority 5: Re-test with Healthy Ollama (Verification)

**Validates results**

- Current run had 114s Ollama response time
- Healthy Ollama: <5s response time
- May eliminate most "Ollama timeout" failures

## Conclusion

The timeout fix is **working correctly** - it's detecting Ollama hangs and preventing indefinite waits. The "unknown failures" are actually successful timeout detections during a period of severe Ollama degradation.

The real bugs are:
1. **Subprocess buffer deadlock** (25% of failures)
2. **Poor error recovery from command restrictions** (33% of failures)

Both are fixable with targeted improvements to the test framework and agent error handling.
