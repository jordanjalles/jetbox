# L3-L4-L5 Evaluation Run Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Purpose:** Test new agent features (tree visualization, accomplishment tracking, failure reports) on advanced tasks

---

## Test Configuration

**Test Levels:**
- **L3 (Advanced)**: Refactoring, bug fixing, feature addition
- **L4 (Expert)**: Complex classes, debugging, optimization
- **L5 (Extreme)**: Multi-format pipelines, large refactoring, ambiguous requirements

**Agent Configuration:**
- `max_per_subtask`: 12 rounds (increased from 6 for harder tasks)
- `max_approach_retries`: 3 attempts at root
- `strategy`: force_decompose (no give-up option)
- `zoom_out_target`: root (full approach reconsideration)

## Tests to be Run

### Level 3: Advanced (3 tests)
1. **L3-1: Refactor to Class**
   - Task: Create calculator.py, then refactor to use Calculator class
   - Timeout: 240s

2. **L3-2: Fix Buggy Code**
   - Task: Fix all bugs in buggy.py
   - Timeout: 240s

3. **L3-3: Add Feature to Package**
   - Task: Add square_root to mathx/advanced.py with tests
   - Timeout: 240s

### Level 4: Expert (3 tests)
1. **L4-1: TodoList with Persistence**
   - Task: Create TodoList class with JSON persistence and tests
   - Timeout: 300s

2. **L4-2: Debug Failing Tests**
   - Task: Fix broken.py so test_broken.py passes
   - Timeout: 300s

3. **L4-3: Optimize Slow Code**
   - Task: Optimize fibonacci using memoization/DP
   - Timeout: 300s

### Level 5: Extreme (3 tests)
1. **L5-1: Multi-Format Data Pipeline**
   - Task: CSV/JSON/XML converter with unified interface
   - Timeout: 360s

2. **L5-2: Large-Scale Refactoring**
   - Task: Refactor mathx to use MathOperation base class
   - Timeout: 360s

3. **L5-3: Ambiguous Requirements**
   - Task: Create useful text file utility (intentionally vague)
   - Timeout: 360s

## Setup Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Missing agent_config.py
**Problem:** Agent couldn't import agent_config module
**Cause:** File was created but not saved properly
**Fix:** Recreated agent_config.py with full configuration loader

### Issue 2: Cleanup Script Removing Config
**Problem:** stress test cleanup was deleting agent_config.py
**Cause:** Not in preserve_files list
**Fix:** Added "agent_config.py" to preserve_files set in run_stress_tests.py

## Current Status

**Eval Run:** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (background job: ebaf08)
**Output File:** `eval_final.txt`
**Results File:** `stress_test_results.json`

---

## Expected Outcomes

With new features:
- **Tree visualization** should help see progress through complex hierarchies
- **Accomplishment tracking** should help agent learn from partial success
- **Failure reports** should provide detailed debugging info when tests fail
- **Approach reconsideration** (3x) should give agent multiple chances on hard tasks

Previous runs (without new features) showed many "unknown_failure" and "max_rounds" issues.
With increased max_per_subtask (6â†’12) and better failure handling, we expect improved results.

## Analysis

Results will show:
1. Success rate per level (L3/L4/L5)
2. Common failure modes
3. Average rounds/duration per test
4. Which features (tree viz, context tracking) helped most

Full analysis will be available after test completion in:
- `eval_final.txt` - Full output
- `stress_test_results.json` - Structured results
- `reports/failure_report_*.md` - Detailed failure reports (if generated)

---

## Next Steps

After eval completes:
1. Review success rates and failure modes
2. Analyze generated failure reports
3. Check if new features improved agent performance
4. Document findings and recommendations
