# L3-L7 Test Failure Analysis

**Test Run:** 30 tests completed (out of 75 planned before crash)  
**Pass Rate:** 46.7% (14 passed, 16 failed)  
**Date:** 2025-10-24

---

## Executive Summary

The L3-L7 stress test identified **three distinct failure patterns**:

1. **Timeouts (10 failures)** - Agent process hangs during initialization, never starts executing
2. **Infinite Loops (4 failures)** - Loop detector correctly identifies repeated actions
3. **Unknown Failures (3 failures)** - Agent crashes early within 6 rounds

---

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. TIMEOUTS (10 failures - 59% of failures)

**Characteristic:** 0 rounds executed, timeout after 240-480 seconds

| Test ID | Test Name | Timeout | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------|
| L4-3 | Optimize Slow Code | 360s | Passed in iteration 1, timed out in iteration 2 |
| L6-1 | Web API with Tests | 420s | Failed 3 times (different iterations) |
| L6-2 | Plugin System Architecture | 420s | Complex task |
| L7-1 | Multi-Module Dependency Resolution | 480s | Highest timeout threshold |
| L3-2 | Fix Buggy Code | 240s | Also had infinite loop in iteration 1 |
| L3-3 | Add Feature to Package | 240s | Also had infinite loop in iteration 1 |
| L4-1 | TodoList with Persistence | 300s | - |
| L4-2 | Debug Failing Tests | 300s | Failed multiple times |

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

The agent process is **hanging during initialization** or **early execution** before completing even 1 round. Possible causes:

1. **Ollama Response Delay**: Despite health check passing, Ollama may be slow to respond to actual LLM calls
2. **Subprocess Deadlock**: The `subprocess.run()` call may be deadlocking on stdout/stderr buffer
3. **Agent Initialization Hang**: `probe_state()` or initial context building may be blocking
4. **Iteration-Specific Issue**: L4-3 passed first time but timed out second time - suggests environmental issue

**Evidence:**
- Tests that timeout show NO output (0 rounds)
- Same test (L4-3) passed iteration 1 but failed iteration 2
- Cleanup function runs successfully (prints "[cleanup] Removed...")
- Ollama health check passes before each test

---

### 2. INFINITE LOOPS (4 failures - 24% of failures)

**Characteristic:** Loop detector triggers after 11-38 rounds

| Test ID | Test Name | Rounds | Duration | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| L3-2 | Fix Buggy Code | 11 | 40.5s | Quick loop detection |
| L3-3 | Add Feature to Package | 25 | 171.6s | Medium complexity |
| L5-2 | Large-Scale Refactoring | 38 | 134.8s | High complexity |
| L7-3 | DSL Parser and Interpreter | 38 | 224.5s | Longest loop |

**Root Cause:**

Loop detector is **working correctly**. These are genuine infinite loops where the agent:
- Repeats the same action pattern
- Doesn't make progress toward goal
- Needs better error recovery or approach reconsideration

**Positive Observation:** The loop detector prevented tests from hanging indefinitely.

---

### 3. UNKNOWN FAILURES (3 failures - 18% of failures)

**Characteristic:** Early crash at 6 rounds, duration 11-39 seconds

| Test ID | Test Name | Rounds | Duration |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| L4-2 | Debug Failing Tests | 6 | 11.3s |
| L4-2 | Debug Failing Tests | 6 | 38.9s |
| L4-2 | Debug Failing Tests | 6 | 20.4s |

**Observation:** 
- ALL 3 unknown failures are the **same test (L4-2)** across different iterations
- Consistent 6-round count suggests hitting a specific failure condition
- Quick duration (11-38s) suggests early crash, not timeout

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**

L4-2 specifically has an issue:
- Test task: "Debug the code in broken.py and fix all issues so tests pass"
- Setup: `setup_failing_tests(task)` creates broken.py and test_broken.py
- Agent may be:
  - Crashing when encountering the intentionally broken code
  - Hitting a specific bug when running failing tests
  - Exiting early due to missing dependencies or test framework issue

## Success Patterns

### Tests That Passed Consistently

| Test ID | Test Name | Avg Rounds | Avg Duration | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| L3-1 | Refactor to Class | 6 | 26.9s | Simple refactoring |
| L5-1 | Multi-Format Data Pipeline | 43-47 | 164-185s | Complex but successful |
| L5-2 | Large-Scale Refactoring | 78 | 283.7s | Longest successful test |
| L5-3 | Ambiguous Requirements | 9 | 27.9s | Handled ambiguity well |
| L7-1 | Multi-Module Dependency | 18 | 36.5s | Complex logic handled well |

**Key Observation:** Tests requiring **file operations and package structure** succeed more reliably than tests requiring **external dependencies (Flask)** or **debugging existing code**.

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Timeout Issue (Affects 59% of failures)

1. **Add timeout debugging**: Log agent startup progress to identify where it hangs
2. **Increase buffer size**: Use `subprocess.Popen` with explicit `bufsize=-1`
3. **Add heartbeat**: Agent should log "ROUND X started" immediately for timeout detection
4. **Environment check**: Verify Ollama latency before EACH test, not just health check

### Priority 2: Investigate L4-2 Specific Crash (Affects 18% of failures)

1. **Review setup_failing_tests()**: Check if broken.py causes agent to crash
2. **Add exception handling**: Agent should handle pytest failures gracefully
3. **Check dependencies**: Verify pytest is available and working

### Priority 3: Improve Loop Detection (Working, but could optimize)

1. **Earlier detection**: Current detector triggers at 11-38 rounds; could be faster
2. **Decomposition hints**: When loop detected, suggest task decomposition
3. **Action diversity**: Encourage trying different approaches when stuck

### Priority 4: Fix Test Infrastructure

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Fixed cleanup bug with safe_rmtree() retry logic
2. **TODO**: Add test result persistence on crash (currently no JSON file created)
3. **TODO**: Add progress indicators during long tests

## Test Coverage Analysis

### By Difficulty Level

- **L3 (Advanced)**: 33% pass rate (1/3 passed)
- **L4 (Expert)**: 33% pass rate (1/3 passed)  
- **L5 (Extreme)**: 67% pass rate (2/3 passed)
- **L6 (Master)**: 0% pass rate (0/3 passed - all timeouts)
- **L7 (Grandmaster)**: 50% pass rate (1/2 passed)

**Anomaly:** L5 (Extreme) has better pass rate than L3/L4 (Advanced/Expert). This suggests the issue is **not complexity-related** but rather specific to:
- Tests requiring external dependencies (Flask for L6)
- Tests with deliberate bugs/failures (L4-2)
- Environmental issues causing timeouts

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix cleanup bug (COMPLETED)
2. **Run focused test**: Test L4-2 in isolation to debug unknown failure
3. **Add timeout logging**: Instrument agent.py to log startup progress
4. **Re-run full suite**: With fixes in place, attempt full 75-test run
5. **Analyze loop patterns**: Review agent logs for infinite loop cases
