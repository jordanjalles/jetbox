# Integration Issues Found

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Tool Definitions Duplicated - FIXED
**File:** `task_executor_agent.py`
**Line:** 93-184

**Issue:** `get_tools()` manually defines all tools instead of calling `tools.get_tool_definitions()`.

**Impact:**
- Tool definitions must be maintained in TWO places
- If a tool is added to `tools.py`, must remember to add it to `task_executor_agent.py`
- Descriptions can drift out of sync

**Current State:**
- `tools.py` defines 11 tools (including grep_file and server tools)
- `task_executor_agent.py.get_tools()` only defines 6 tools
- Missing from get_tools(): grep_file, start_server, stop_server, check_server, list_servers

**Solution Applied:**
```python
def get_tools(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Return tools available to TaskExecutor."""
    return tools.get_tool_definitions()
```

**Result:**
- All 11 tools now advertised to LLM (was 6)
- grep_file now available to LLM
- Server tools now available to LLM
- Single source of truth for tool definitions

### 2. orchestrator_status.py Not Integrated - FIXED
**File:** `orchestrator_status.py` (entire file)

**Issue:** File exists with `OrchestratorStatusDisplay` class but is never imported or used.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ grep -r "OrchestratorStatus" --include="*.py" .
orchestrator_status.py:class OrchestratorStatusDisplay:
```

**Impact:**
- Dead code in repository
- Orchestrator has no status display (unlike TaskExecutor)
- Architecture diagram claims it exists but it's not used

**Solution Applied:**
- File removed (not needed)
- Orchestrator uses simple print statements for status
- ARCHITECTURE.txt updated to reflect this

**Committed:** Commit [pending]


### 3. prompt_loader.py Not Used - FIXED
**File:** `prompt_loader.py`

**Issue:** Module exists with `load_prompts()` function but is never imported.

**Current State:**
- prompts.yaml exists
- prompt_loader.py can load prompts from YAML
- But no code calls it

**Impact:**
- prompts.yaml is unused
- Agent prompts are hardcoded in agent_config.yaml instead

**Solution Applied:**
- Deleted prompt_loader.py
- Deleted prompts.yaml
- Agent config remains in agent_config.yaml (YAML config works fine)

**Committed:** Commit [pending]


## Medium Issues (Consider Fixing)

### 4. grep_file Tool Missing from TaskExecutor - FIXED
**File:** `task_executor_agent.py`
**Line:** 81-184

**Issue:** `grep_file` tool is defined in tools.py and in dispatch map, but not in get_tools() list.

**Impact:** Was not advertised to LLM

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed by using tools.get_tool_definitions()
- grep_file now advertised to LLM
- Server tools also now advertised

**Committed:** Commit [pending]


### 5. Server Tools Missing from TaskExecutor Docstring - FIXED
**File:** `task_executor_agent.py`
**Line:** 81-92

**Issue:** Docstring lists 6 tools but get_tools() could return 11.

**Current docstring:**
```python
"""
Tools:
- write_file: Write content to a file
- read_file: Read file contents
- list_dir: List directory contents
- run_cmd: Execute shell commands (whitelisted)
- mark_subtask_complete: Mark current subtask as done
- decompose_task: Break task into subtasks
"""
```

**Missing from docstring:**
- grep_file
- start_server, stop_server, check_server, list_servers

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated docstring to mention all tool categories
- Uses tools.get_tool_definitions() which is self-documenting

**Committed:** Commit [pending]


## Low Priority Issues (Minor)

### 6. Unused Utility Scripts
**Files:** `diag_speed.py`, `dsl.py`, `sitecustomize.py`

**Issue:** Scripts exist but are never imported.

**Analysis:**
- `diag_speed.py` - Standalone utility for diagnosing Ollama speed
- `dsl.py` - Experiment with domain-specific language (incomplete)
- `sitecustomize.py` - Python startup customization

**Impact:** None - these are utilities/experiments, not library code

**Solution:** Document as utilities or move to tools/ directory


### 7. agent_legacy.py Imports Not All in New Agent
**Missing imports:**
- `argparse` - CLI parsing (agent.py handles this now)
- `threading` - Used for server management (still works via server_manager)
- `traceback` - Error handling (could add for better error messages)
- `io` - String buffer operations (not needed)

**Impact:** LOW - most are legacy CLI features


## Fixed Issues (Already Resolved)

### ✅ completion_detector Integration
**Status:** FIXED in commit d348878

**Was:** completion_detector existed but wasn't called in task_executor_agent.py
**Now:** analyze_llm_response() called after each LLM response
**Impact:** Agent now properly signals task completion


## Summary Statistics

- **Fixed issues:** 5 ✅
  - Tool duplication (now uses tools.get_tool_definitions())
  - orchestrator_status.py (removed)
  - prompt_loader.py (removed)
  - grep_file missing (now advertised)
  - docstring out of sync (updated)

- **Low priority remaining:** 2
  - Unused utilities (diag_speed.py, dsl.py, sitecustomize.py)
  - Legacy imports differences

## Actions Completed

1. ✅ Replaced manual tool definitions with `tools.get_tool_definitions()`
2. ✅ Deleted `orchestrator_status.py` (not needed)
3. ✅ Deleted `prompt_loader.py` and `prompts.yaml` (config-based approach is fine)
4. ✅ All tools now advertised to LLM (11 tools vs previous 6)
5. ✅ Updated ARCHITECTURE.txt to reflect changes
6. ✅ Tested agent still works correctly
