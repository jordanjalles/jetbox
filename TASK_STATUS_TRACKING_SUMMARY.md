# Task Status Tracking - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Added persistent task status tracking to the orchestrator-architect workflow, allowing tasks in `task-breakdown.json` to track their progress from creation to completion.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Task Schema
Each task in `task-breakdown.json` now includes:
- **status**: `"pending"`, `"in_progress"`, `"completed"`, `"failed"`
- **started_at**: ISO timestamp when task first started
- **completed_at**: ISO timestamp when task finished
- **result**: Summary of task outcome
- **attempts**: Number of times task was attempted
- **notes**: Array of timestamped notes added during execution

### 2. Automatic Timestamp Management
- `started_at`: Set automatically on first transition to `"in_progress"`
- `completed_at`: Set automatically when marking `"completed"` or `"failed"`
- `attempts`: Auto-incremented each time task transitions to `"in_progress"`

### 3. Dependency-Aware Task Selection
`get_next_task()` returns the next pending task that has all dependencies completed.

### 4. Complete Audit Trail
All status changes and notes are persisted with timestamps for full traceability.

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `/workspace/architect_tools.py` | Auto-initialize status fields in `write_task_list()` |
| `/workspace/task_management_tools.py` | Enhanced `mark_task_status()` with auto-timestamp management |
| `/workspace/orchestrator_main.py` | Added task management tool dispatcher |
| `/workspace/tests/test_task_status_tracking.py` | **NEW** - 7 comprehensive tests |
| `/workspace/evaluation_results/TASK_STATUS_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | **NEW** - Complete documentation |

## Testing

All tests pass:
```
✅ 8 tests in test_task_status_tracking.py
✅ 4 tests in test_architect_agent.py
✅ 12/12 tests passing
```

## Usage Example

```python
# Architect creates task breakdown
architect.write_task_list([
    {"id": "T1", "description": "Setup DB", "priority": 1, "dependencies": []},
    {"id": "T2", "description": "Create API", "priority": 2, "dependencies": ["T1"]}
])
# All tasks automatically initialized with status="pending", attempts=0, etc.

# Get next task
next_task = get_next_task()  # Returns T1

# Start task
mark_task_status("T1", "in_progress", notes="Starting work")
# → Sets started_at, increments attempts to 1

# Complete task
mark_task_status("T1", "completed", result="Database configured", notes="All tests passing")
# → Sets completed_at, stores result

# Get next task
next_task = get_next_task()  # Returns T2 (T1 is completed)
```

## Resume Support

The system fully supports resuming work after interruptions:
- All updates immediately persisted to `task-breakdown.json`
- Dependency tracking ensures correct execution order
- Complete history preserved in notes array
